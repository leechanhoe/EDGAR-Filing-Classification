On April 9, 2025, the U. S. government, or USG, informed NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company, that the USG requires a license for export to China ( including Hong Kong and Macau ) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of the Company’s H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. The USG indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China. On April 14, 2025, the USG informed the Company that the license requirement will be in effect for the indefinite future. The Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2026 ends on April 27, 2025. First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.

Fiscal year 2026 refers to the Company’s fiscal year ending January 25, 2026. The Compensation Committee has set the Performance Goals for fiscal year 2026 based upon the achievement of specified fiscal year 2026 revenue and has established threshold compensation plan, base compensation plan, and stretch compensation plan levels. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, a participant must remain an employee through the payment date under the 2026 Plan to be eligible to earn an award.

Emerging Growth Company ☐ If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13( a ) of the Exchange Act. ☐Item 8.01 Other EventsThe “AI Diffusion” RuleOn January 13, 2025, the U. S. Government announced that it submitted the Interim Final Rule, “Export Control Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion,” or the IFR, for publication in the Federal Register. The rule published in the Federal Register on January 15, 2025 at 90 Fed. Reg. 4544. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3 A090.a, 4 A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, ( including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems ) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3 A090.a or 4 A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density. Unless one of the new license exceptions is available to specific transactions, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3 A090.a or 4 A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40 S, and RTX 6000 Ada. The IFR is subject to a notice and public comment period of 120 days from publication, i.e., by May 15, 2025. Unless the IFR is modified, in whole or in part, or withdrawn altogether by the incoming Trump Administration, exporters, reexports, and transferors are required to begin compliance with the IFR’s licensing, reporting, and other requirements on May 15, 2025. The Company supports U. S. leadership in innovation by providing cutting-edge solutions, working to make American advancements a global standard, and constantly pursuing rapid progress. The Company supports creating new datacenters in the United States and promotes efforts to develop the necessary infrastructure. The Company also supports the safe and responsible development and deployment of all AI-powered systems and will provide feedback on the IFR during the notice and comment period. The “Additional Due Diligence Measures” RuleOn January 16, 2025, the Bureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce, published a rule entitled “Implementation of Additional Due Diligence Measures for Advanced Computing Integrated Circuits.” The rule is intended to reduce the diversion of ICs to unauthorized end uses or end users that meet the control parameters of ECCN 3 A090 by end users who misrepresent the performance capabilities of their ICs to the foundries that manufacture them or the companies that assemble the ICs, or OSATs, into packages. The rule requires additional diligence for foundries and OSATs to verify technical parameters, although approved IC designers are considered a reliable source to verify technical parameters of the applicable advanced logic ICs. NVIDIA Corporation is an approved IC designer and thus the rule is not expected to have an impact on our operations or on product sales to China. Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K including statements regarding the scope of the licensing requirement under the IFR; NVIDIA’s products that are subject to the IFR; the impact of the IFR on NVIDIA’s future products; the effectiveness and effective date of the IFR; NVIDIA providing feedback on the IFR during the notice and comment period; and the “Implementation of Additional Due Diligence Measures for Advanced Computing Integrated Circuits” rule unexpected to have an impact on NVIDIA’s operations or on product sales to China are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; NVIDIA’s reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test NVIDIA’s products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to NVIDIA’s existing product and technologies; market acceptance of NVIDIA’s products or its partners’ products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of NVIDIA’s products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the most recent reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including, but not limited to, its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
