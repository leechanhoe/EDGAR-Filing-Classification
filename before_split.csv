The Indenture contains customary events of default
with respect to the Senior Notes, including failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants,
acceleration of certain other indebtedness, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Events of default under the Indenture arising
from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency will automatically cause the acceleration of the amounts due under the Senior Notes. If
any other event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing with respect to a series of Senior Notes, the Trustee or the holders
of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes of such series may declare the acceleration of the
amounts due under the Senior Notes of such series.

On May 9, 2025, Eaton Capital Unlimited Company (“Eaton Capital”), a
subsidiary of Eaton Corporation plc (the “Company”), closed its sale of 3.625% senior notes due 2035 (the “Euro Notes”), in the
principal amount of €500 million and 4.450% senior notes due 2030 (the “U.S. Notes” and together with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”),
in the principal amount of $500 million.
The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) on Form S-3ASR (No. 333-281174) previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Notes were sold pursuant to a prospectus, dated August 1, 2024
(the “Base Prospectus”), forming a part of the Company’s Registration Statement, separate preliminary prospectus supplements in respect of each of the Euro Notes and U.S. Notes dated May
6, 2025 (respectively, the “Euro Preliminary Prospectus Supplement” and the “U.S. Preliminary Prospectus Supplement” and,
collectively, the “Preliminary Prospectus Supplements”) and separate final prospectus supplements in respect of each of the Euro Notes and the U.S. Notes, dated May 6, 2025 (respectively,
the “Euro Final Prospectus Supplement” and the “U.S. Final Prospectus Supplement” and, collectively, the “Final Prospectus Supplements” and, together with the Preliminary Prospectus Supplements, the “Prospectus Supplements”).
The aggregate net proceeds received by Eaton Capital from the sale of the Euro Notes were approximately €493.6 million, after
deducting the underwriting discount and expenses, and the aggregate net proceeds received by Eaton Capital from the sale of the U.S. Notes were approximately $494.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses. Eaton Capital
intends to use the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the repayment of outstanding debt, including commercial paper.
The Notes were guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary
Guarantors”) and issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of May 9, 2025 (the “Base Indenture”), among Eaton Capital, the Company,
the Subsidiary Guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture in respect to the Euro Notes,
dated as of May 9, 2025 (the “First Supplemental Indenture”), and a second supplemental indenture in respect to the U.S. Notes, dated as of May 9, 2025 (the “Second Supplement Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture and First Supplement Indenture, the “Indenture”). Capitalized terms used that are
otherwise not defined have the meanings given to them in the Indenture.
Interest on the Euro Notes is payable annually in arrears on May 9, commencing on May 9, 2026. The Euro Notes will bear interest
at 3.625% per year. The Euro Notes will mature on May 9, 2035. Interest on the U.S. Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each May 9 and November 9, commencing on November 9, 2025. The U.S. Notes will bear interest at 4.450% per year. The
U.S. Notes will mature on May 9, 2030.
Prior to February 9, 2035, Eaton Capital may redeem the Euro Notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to
time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon
discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (assuming an Actual/Actual (ICMA) day count fraction) at the Comparable Government Bond Rate, plus 20 basis points, less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption, and (2) 100% of the
principal amount of the Euro Notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
Prior to April 9, 2030, Eaton Capital may redeem the U.S. Notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to
time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon
discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate, plus 10 basis points, less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption, and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the U.S. Notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case,
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
On or after February 9, 2035 and April 9, 2030, Eaton Capital may redeem the Euro Notes and U.S. Notes, respectively, in whole or in
part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
The Notes are subject to redemption upon at least 10 days but not more than 60 days’ notice to each registered holder of the Notes
to be redeemed, at any time, as a whole or in part, at the election of Eaton Capital, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
The Notes are Eaton Capital’s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, ranking equally with Eaton Capital’s other unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The guarantees of the Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, ranking equally with their other respective unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding.

1.02. TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
As
previously reported on March 14, 2025, TE Connectivity plc (“TE Connectivity”) entered into a 364-Day Senior Credit Agreement
(the “Credit Agreement”), by and among TE Connectivity, as parent
guarantor, its wholly-owned subsidiary TE Connectivity
Switzerland Ltd. (the “Swiss TE”), as intermediate guarantor, its wholly-owned subsidiary Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”),
as borrower, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, which provides for revolving credit commitments
in the aggregate amount of $1,500,000,000 (the “364-Day Facility”). The 364-Day Facility backed TE Connectivity’s borrowings
under its commercial paper program incurred in connection with the financing of TE Connectivity’s acquisition of the Richards Manufacturing
business, which was consummated on April 1, 2025.
As a result of the successful issuance of Notes
described below and the previously disclosed issuance on May 6, 2025 of euro-denominated notes, TE Connectivity has voluntarily elected
to terminate the 364-Day Facility, effective May 16, 2025. There were no borrowings under the 364-Day Facility outstanding as of May 9,
2025. Following the termination of the facility and expected repayment of outstanding commercial paper with the net proceeds of the new
notes issuances, TE Connectivity also expects to reduce the capacity of its existing commercial paper program from $2.75 billion to $1.25
billion.
Item
8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
On May 9, 2025, TEGSA issued $450,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of its 4.500% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”) and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its
5.000% Senior Notes due 2035 (the “2035 Notes” and, together with the 2031 Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes were
offered and sold by TEGSA pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-282440) (the “Registration
Statement”). The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately $887.5 million after deducting the underwriters’discount but before other expenses, and, together with any net proceeds received from the concurrent Euro notes offering, will be used
for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Richards Manufacturing
business.
The Notes are governed by an amended and restated
indenture, dated as of January 31, 2025 (the “Indenture”), among TEGSA, as issuer, TE Connectivity, as parent guarantor, Swiss
TE, as additional guarantor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented by the
Third Supplemental Indenture governing the 2031 Notes, dated as of May 9, 2025 (the “Third Supplemental Indenture”) and the
Fourth Supplemental Indenture governing the 2035 Notes, dated as of May 9, 2025 (the “Fourth Supplemental Indenture”), among
TEGSA, as issuer, TE Connectivity, as parent guarantor, Swiss TE, as additional guarantor, and the Trustee. The Trustee will receive customary
fees in connection therewith. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment on an unsecured senior basis by TE Connectivity
and Swiss TE (the “Guarantees”). The Notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment
with all of its existing and future senior debt, and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
2
The Notes were offered pursuant to an underwriting
agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”), dated as of April 29, 2025, among TEGSA, as issuer, TE Connectivity, as parent guarantor,
Swiss TE, as additional guarantor, and Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., in their capacity
as representatives of the several underwriters (the “Underwriters”). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and subject to
the terms and conditions expressed therein, TEGSA agreed to sell the Notes to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase
the Notes for resale to the public. On April 29, 2025, TE Connectivity issued a press release announcing the pricing of the Notes. A copy
of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
The
foregoing descriptions of the Indenture, the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement
do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture,
which was filed
as Exhibit 4.1 to TE Connectivity’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on January 31, 2025, the Third Supplemental Indenture, which
is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, which is filed as Exhibit 4.2 hereto, and the Underwriting Agreement,
which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto. The foregoing documents are incorporated by reference herein.
In connection with the offering of the Notes, TE
Connectivity is filing as Exhibits 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 hereto opinions of counsel addressing the validity of the Notes and the Guarantees
and certain related matters. Such opinions are incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.

on or after the date that is one month prior to the maturity date of the 2031 Notes and if the Company redeems the 2035 Notes on or after
the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of the 2035 Notes, the redemption price for those Notes will equal 100% of the

up to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The Supplemental Indentures
contain customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Notes, then the Trustee or the
holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that series may declare the Notes of that series to be due

all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the holders
of the Notes.

Certificate of Incorporation
On May 7, 2025, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

As a result, the shares of the Corporation’s preferred stock previously designated as Series A Preferred Stock are no longer so designated and resume the status of undesignated shares of preferred stock of the Corporation.
At the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Corporation held on May 7, 2025 (the “Annual Meeting”), upon the recommendation of the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), the Corporation’s stockholders approved amendments to the Corporation’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation removing all provisions thereof requiring a supermajority vote of the stockholders of the Corporation and providing for the exculpation of the Corporation’s officers as authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, all as more fully described in the Corporation’s definitive proxy statement for the Annual Meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2025 (the “Approved Amendments”).
An Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation reflecting the elimination of the Corporation’s Series A Preferred Stock and the Approved Amendments was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and became effective on May 7, 2025. A copy of such Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is included as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Amended and Restated By-Laws
On May 7, 2025, the Board approved the amendment and restatement of the Corporation’s By-Laws (the “Amended and Restated By-Laws”), effective immediately. The changes reflected in the Amended and Restated By-Laws include:•Removing all provisions thereof providing for a supermajority vote of the stockholders of the Corporation;•Setting forth certain informational and other requirements to be satisfied in connection with any advance notice relating to the nomination of director candidates or the presentation of business at an annual meeting of stockholders and the solicitation of stockholders;•Establishing the Delaware state courts, or if no state court located in Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware, as the exclusive forum for certain legal actions relating to the Corporation under Delaware law, unless the Corporation otherwise agrees;•Addressing procedural matters reflecting changes to Delaware law and relating to the adjournment of meetings of stockholders;•Updating provisions relating to the calling of special meetings of the Board to permit the Board Chair, President or a majority of directors then in office (or one director in the event there is only a single director in office) to call a special meeting; and•Making various other technical, ministerial, administrative, conforming and clarifying changes.

Notes
:
Required votes
. For Proposal 1, as required by Valero’s bylaws, each director is to be elected by a majority of votes cast with respect to that director’s election. Any director nominee who does not receive a majority of the votes cast is required to submit an irrevocable resignation to the Board, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation or take other action. The Board will, within 90 days following certification of the election results, publicly disclose its decision regarding any such resignation and the rationale behind the decision. Proposals 2 and 3 required approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote.
Effect of abstentions.
Shares voted to abstain are treated as “present” for purposes of determining a quorum. In the election of directors (Proposal 1), pursuant to Valero’s bylaws, shares voted to abstain are not deemed to be “votes cast,” and are accordingly disregarded. When, however, approval for a proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote (Proposals 2 and 3), then shares voted to abstain have the effect of a negative vote.
Effect of broker
non-votes.
Brokers holding shares for the beneficial owners of such shares must vote according to specific instructions received from the beneficial owners. If instructions are not received, in some instances (e.g., for Proposal 3), a broker may nevertheless vote the shares in the broker’s discretion. Under New York Stock Exchange rules, brokers are precluded from exercising voting discretion on certain proposals without specific instructions from the beneficial owner (Proposals 1 and 2). This results in a“broker non-vote”on the proposal. A broker
non-vote
is treated as “present” for purposes of determining a quorum, has the effect of a negative vote when approval for a particular proposal requires the affirmative vote of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Valero, and has no effect when approval for a proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote or a plurality or majority of the votes cast.
Item 8.01.
Other Events.
Effective on May 6, 2025, Valero entered into a Stock Unit Award Agreement with each of its
non-employee
directors who was
re-elected
at Valero’s 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. The grant of stock units, valued at $200,000 calculated pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation–Stock Compensation (with the number of units rounded up to avoid fractional units), represents the equity portion of Valero’s
non-employee
director compensation program. Each stock unit represents the right to receive one share of Valero common stock, and is scheduled to vest (become nonforfeitable) on the date of Valero’s 2026 annual meeting of stockholders, subject to an additional
one-year
holding period. The foregoing description of the stock units is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the agreement governing the awards, the form of which is attached as Exhibit 10.01 to this Current Report on Form

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 9, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), Constellation Brands, Inc. (the “Company”), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), and certain other lenders (the “Credit Agreement Lenders”), entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement” and loans made thereunder the “Term Loans”).
The Credit Agreement provides for a delayed draw term loan available in up to two draws in the aggregate principal amount of $500 million. If the Company elects to draw under the Credit Agreement, it intends to use the proceeds of the Term Loans for general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness. The commitments under the Credit Agreement will terminate on the earliest of (i) the date on which such commitments have been fully drawn or terminated pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, (ii) the second date on which the Term Loans are funded pursuant to the terms and conditions to funding set forth in the Credit Agreement and (iii) November 7, 2025. The Term Loans will mature two years after the date on which the initial borrowing, if any, of the Term Loans occurs.
The Term Loans will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at Term SOFR or Base Rate (each, as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus (i) in the case of Term SOFR Term Loans, a margin ranging from 0.750% to 1.250% per annum based on the Company’s credit rating as determined by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and (ii) in the case of Base Rate Term Loans, a margin ranging from 0.000% to 0.250% per annum based on the Company’s credit rating as determined by S&P or Moody’s. Unused commitments under the Credit Agreement will incur a ticking fee of 0.080% per annum, which ticking fee will begin to accrue on the date that is 30 days after the Effective Date.
The Credit Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that the Company considers customary for facilities of this type and which are consistent with the Company’s existing Eleventh Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of April 28, 2025 (the “Revolving Facility”). Such covenants include, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. Consistent with the Revolving Facility, the Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 2.50:1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter and a maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement and which shall be calculated net of up to $750 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) of 4.00:1:00 with a
step-up
to 4.50:1.00 with respect to the four fiscal quarters following a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default consistent with the Revolving Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default after any applicable grace or cure period, any outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and/or the Credit Agreement Lenders’ commitments may be terminated.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 9, 2025, CoStar Group, Inc. (“CoStar Group” or the “Company”) entered into a binding Scheme Implementation Deed (the “SID”) with
Domain Holdings Australia Limited (ASX:DHG) (“Domain”) to acquire 100% of the issued capital of Domain not previously acquired by CoStar Group by way of Scheme of Arrangement (the “Domain Transaction”). Pursuant to the SID, Domain shareholders will be entitled to receive total cash consideration of $4.43 AUD per Domain ordinary share, less any special dividend declared or paid by Domain after May 9, 2025,
subject to all applicable conditions being satisfied (or waived) and the scheme being implemented. As previously disclosed, in February 2025, the Company acquired approximately 17% of Domain’s ordinary shares at $4.20 AUD per Domain ordinary share for a total purchase price of approximately $452 million AUD ($285 million). The Company expects to spend approximately $2.3 billion AUD ($1.5 billion) to acquire the remaining approximately 83% of Domain’s ordinary shares upon consummation of the Domain Transaction.
The SID is subject to customary conditions for a transaction of this nature, including: (i) Domain shareholder approval; (ii) court approval; (iii) Australian Foreign Investment Review Board approval; (iv) an independent expert concluding (and continuing to conclude) that the scheme is in the best interest of Domain shareholders; and (v) No “Material Adverse Change” or “Prescribed Occurrences” (each as defined in the SID) occurring in respect of Domain.
The SID contains customary exclusivity provisions, including “no shop,” “no talk” and “no due diligence” obligations (subject to a customary fiduciary carve out), “notification” obligations and a “matching” right. The SID also provides for certain customary circumstances in which a break fee would be payable to the Company or a reverse break fee would be payable to Domain, in each case equal to approximately $28 million AUD ($18 million).
The foregoing summary of the SID does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the SID, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 7.01
Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 9, 2025, the Company issued a press release (the “Press Release”) announcing the entry into the SID for the Domain Transaction. A copy of the Press Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
The information contained in this Item 7.01 and the Press Release shall be considered “furnished” and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any reports or filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), whether made before or after the date hereof, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding the Domain Transaction, the expected timetable for completing the Domain Transaction, future financial and operating results, benefits and synergies of the Domain Transaction, future opportunities for the combined businesses and any other statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future, may be “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws. These forward-looking statements, involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect the financial or operating results of CoStar Group, Domain or the combined company. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “will,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. CoStar Group can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained and, therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. For example, these forward-looking statements could be affected by factors including, without limitation, risks associated with the ability to consummate the Domain Transaction and the timing of the closing of the Domain Transaction; the ability to successfully integrate operations and employees; the ability to realize anticipated benefits and synergies of the Domain Transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors; the potential impact of announcement of the Domain Transaction or consummation of the Domain Transaction on business relationships, including with employees, customers, suppliers and competitors; unfavorable outcomes of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against CoStar Group or Domain; the ability to
retain key personnel; costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Domain Transaction; and general adverse economic conditions. Moreover, other risks and uncertainties of which the Company is not currently aware may also affect these forward-looking statements and may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. More information about these risks and uncertainties, and other potential factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those stated in the Company’s filings from time to time with the SEC, including in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, each of which is filed with the SEC, including in the “Risk Factors” section of those filings, as well as the Company’s other filings with the SEC (including Current Reports on Form 8-K) available at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the Company on the date hereof, and the Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

political conditions in the markets in which we operate or volatility in currency exchange rates.

The Tender Offers are made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated April 25, 2025.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 8, 2025, Evergy, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with each of (a) Barclays Capital Inc. (“Barclays”), BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”), Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citigroup”), Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman”), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”), Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), MUFG Securities Americas Inc. (“MUFG”), TD Securities (USA) LLC (“TD Securities”), Truist Securities, Inc. (“Truist”) and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“Wells Fargo”), each acting as sales agent for the Company (each, a “Manager” and, collectively, the “Managers”), (b) Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, MUFG Securities EMEA plc, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, Truist Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, each acting as forward purchaser (each , a “Forward Purchaser” and, collectively, the “Forward Purchasers”) and (c) Barclays, BofA Securities, Citigroup, Goldman, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, MUFG, TD Securities, Truist and Wells Fargo, each acting as agent for its affiliated Forward Purchaser (each a “Forward Seller” and, collectively, the “Forward Sellers”); with respect to the offering and sale from time to time through the Managers or the Forward Sellers of shares of the Company’s common stock, without par value (“common stock”), having an aggregate offering price of up to $1,200,000,000 (including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to the forward sale agreements described below, the “Shares”). Sales of the Shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions through the facilities of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed between the Company and the Managers or the Forward Sellers. Under the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company may also sell Shares from time to time to a Manager as principal for its own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that each Manager, when it is acting as the Company’s sales agent, will be entitled to a commission of up to 2% of the gross offering proceeds of the Shares sold through such Manager. The Company has no obligation to offer or sell any Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may at any time suspend offers and sales under the Equity Distribution Agreement.
The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that, in addition to the issuance and sale of Shares by the Company to or through the Managers, the Company may enter into forward sale agreements under the separate master forward sale confirmations (collectively, the “Master Forward Confirmations”) each dated May 8, 2025 between the Company and each Forward Purchaser and the related supplemental confirmations to be entered into between the Company and the relevant Forward Purchaser (each supplemental confirmation, together with the related Master Forward Confirmation, a “Forward Agreement”). In connection with any Forward Agreement, the relevant Forward Purchaser or its affiliate will borrow from third parties and, through its affiliated Forward Seller, sell a number of Shares equal to the number of Shares underlying the particular Forward Agreement. In no event will the aggregate number of Shares sold through the Managers or the Forward Sellers under the Equity Distribution Agreement and under any Forward Agreement have an aggregate sales price in excess of $1,200,000,000.
The Company will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of borrowed Shares by a Forward Seller. The Company expects to receive proceeds from the sale of Shares by a Forward Seller upon future physical settlement of the relevant Forward Agreement with the relevant Forward Purchaser on dates specified by the Company on or prior to the maturity date of the relevant Forward Agreement. If the Company elects to cash settle or net share settle a Forward Agreement, the Company may not (in the case of cash settlement) or will not (in the case of net share settlement) receive any proceeds, and the Company may owe cash (in the case of cash settlement) or shares of common stock (in the case of net share settlement) to the relevant Forward Purchaser. In connection with each Forward Agreement, the relevant Forward Seller will receive, in the form of a reduced initial forward
sale price payable by the relevant Forward Purchaser under its Forward Agreement, a commission of up to 2% of the gross sales price of all borrowed Shares sold during the applicable forward hedge selling period by it or its affiliate as a Forward Seller.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds, if any, (x) from the offering, after deducting the Managers’ commissions and its offering expenses and (y) payable upon settlement of any Forward Agreement, in each case, for general corporate purposes, which may include investment in the Company’s subsidiaries.
The Shares offered by any Manager or Forward Seller will be so offered pursuant to the Company’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form
S-3
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 16, 2024 (Registration
No. 333-281614).

LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc., TD Securities (USA) LLC, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as agents (the “Agents” and each, an “Agent”), and Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America, N.A., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Mizuho Markets Americas LLC, MUFG Securities EMEA plc, The Toronto-Dominion Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as forward purchasers (collectively, the “Forward Purchasers” and each, a “Forward Purchaser”). Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company may sell from time to time through any Agent, as the Company’s sales agent, shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $1,300,000,000 (the “Shares”). Sales of the Shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the Nasdaq Global Select Market at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by the Company and the Agents.
In addition to the issuance and sale of Shares by the Company through the Agents, the Company also may enter into forward confirmations (the “Forward Confirmations” and each, a “Forward Confirmation”) with any of the Forward Purchasers. In connection with each Forward Confirmation, the relevant Forward Purchaser will, at the Company’s request, borrow from third parties and, through such Forward Purchaser’s relevant Agent, acting as a forward seller, sell a number of Shares equal to the number of Shares that underlie the Forward Confirmation to hedge the Forward Confirmation.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sales of the Shares, after deducting the Agents’ commission and offering expenses, for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment, refinancing, repurchase or redemption of debt, working capital, construction and acquisition expenditures and investments. The Company will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of borrowed Shares by an Agent, acting as a forward seller. The Company expects to receive proceeds from the sale of Shares upon future physical settlement of the relevant Forward Confirmation with the relevant Forward Purchaser on dates specified by the Company on or prior to the maturity date of the relevant Forward Confirmation.
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company may also sell Shares from time to time to any Agent as principal for its own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of Shares to an Agent as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate terms agreement between the Company and such Agent.
The Shares will be issued pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form
S-3
(Registration
No. 333-276062).
The Company filed a prospectus supplement, dated May 9, 2025, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares. You may obtain these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.
The Agents and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of financial and
non-financial

New
Employment Agreement with Chief Executive Officer
On
May 9, 2025, Janus Henderson Group plc (the “Company”) entered into an employment agreement, effective May 12,
2025, with Ali Dibadj, the current Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company (the “CEO Employment Agreement”).
The CEO Employment Agreement supersedes and replaces Mr. Dibadj’s Offer Letter of Employment and Severance Rights Agreement,
each dated March 23, 2022 (the “Prior Agreements”), both of which were scheduled to expire before the end of June 2025.
Our Board views Mr. Dibadj as the most appropriate person to continue to lead Janus Henderson and, therefore, the Company entered
into the new CEO Employment Agreement with the goal of retaining him for the next five years.
Pursuant
to the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Dibadj will be paid an annual base salary of $725,000, and he will continue to be eligible to
participate in the Company’s discretionary variable compensation program. The CEO Employment Agreement provides for Mr. Dibadj’s
annual Target Variable Compensation for 2025 to be $12,775,000.  Consistent with prior practice, the variable compensation remains
performance-based, and the actual amount earned will be dependent on the level of achievement of applicable goals, which may include a
combination of individual and Company-related performance objectives, each of which shall be determined in good faith by the Human Capital
and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company expects that, consistent with prior practice, the variable compensation
earned will be paid 40% in cash and 60% in deferred equity awards which will be paid 40% in the form of JHG restricted stock units and
60% in the form of performance share units. Mr. Dibadj’s variable compensation will be subject to the Company’s policies
related to malus and clawback and will be otherwise generally subject to the standard terms and conditions applicable to equity incentive
awards granted to senior executives of the Company.
The
CEO Employment Agreement further provides that, as soon as practicable following the effective date of the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Dibadj
will receive a one-time special award (the “Special Award”) in the form of Company performance share units (“PSUs”)
with a target grant date fair market value equal to $12,500,000 and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with a grant date
fair market value equal to $7,500,000. The Special Award is eligible to vest as follows: The PSUs vest on the fifth anniversary of the
grant date, subject to Mr. Dibadj’s continued employment with the Company through such date and the achievement of the Total
Shareholder Return (“TSR”) hurdles prior to such date. The payout scale with respect to the PSUs ranges from a payout of 0%
if the cumulative TSR is less than 50% to a payout of 200% of target if the cumulative TSR is at least 150%. The RSUs also vest on the
fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to Mr. Dibadj’s continued employment with the Company through such date. The Board
of Directors believes that the Special Award, particularly the heavy emphasis on PSUs, further aligns the CEO’s interests with those
of the Company’s shareholders by incentivizing the creation of significant shareholder value and enabling our CEO to share in that
value creation. Additionally, the Board of Directors believes that, by both rewarding the CEO for creating that value and requiring five
years of service as a vesting condition, this Special Award greatly enhances the Company’s ability to retain Mr. Dibadj.
The
CEO Employment Agreement also contains severance protections consistent with the prior Severance Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the terms
of the applicable award agreements, the Special Award will forfeit on Mr. Dibadj’s termination of employment by the Company
for any reason (other than due to death or disability) except that if Mr. Dibadj’s employment is terminated by the Company
without Cause or he resigns for Good Reason following a change in control of the Company, the Special Award will fully vest with performance
measured as of the date of the change in control assuming the greater of target and actual performance; provided that, if a change in
control of the Company occurs prior to the first anniversary of the grant date and Mr. Dibadj remains in the role of CEO and the
Special Award is assumed or replaced with an award of substantially the same value and terms (other than with respect to performance metrics),
the Special Award will be forfeited. The severance entitlements under the CEO Employment Agreement and the Special Award are subject to
the execution of a general release of claims in favor of the Company and continued compliance with post-termination restrictive covenants.
The Special Award will also be subject to the Company’s policies related to malus and clawback.

The
preceding descriptions of the CEO Employment Agreement and Special Award are summaries of their material terms, do not purport to be complete,

Award, copies of which will be filed with the Company’s next Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are incorporated herein by reference.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 9, 2025, FS KKR Capital Corp. (the “Company”) entered
into equity distribution agreements, each dated as of May 9, 2025 (the “Equity Distribution Agreements”), by and among the
Company and FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, the Company’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”), and each of Truist Securities, Inc.,
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, KKR Capital Markets LLC, and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. (collectively, the “Sales Agents”).
The Equity Distribution Agreements provide that the Company may from
time to time issue and sell shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $750,000,000
(“Shares”), through the Sales Agents, or to them as principal for their own respective accounts. Any issuance and sale of
Shares will be made pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated May 9, 2025 (the “Prospectus Supplement”) as may be supplemented
from time to time, and the accompanying prospectus, dated September 19, 2024 (together with the Prospectus Supplement, including any documents
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, the “Prospectus”), which constitute a part of the Company’s
effective shelf registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-282226) that was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) on September 19, 2024 (the “Registration Statement”). Sales of Shares, if any, may be made in negotiated
transactions or transactions that are deemed to be “at the market,” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, including sales made directly on The New York Stock Exchange or a similar securities exchange or sales made to or through
a market maker other than on an exchange and by any other method permitted by law, which may include block trades, at prices related to
prevailing market prices or negotiated prices.
The Sales Agents will receive a commission from the Company of up to
1.5% of the gross sales price of any Shares sold through such Sales Agent under the Equity Distribution Agreements. The offering price
per share of Shares less commissions payable under the Equity Distribution Agreements and discounts, if any, will not be less than the
net asset value per share of our common stock at the time of such sale, provided, that the Adviser may, but is not obligated to, from
time to time, in its sole discretion, pay some or all of the commissions payable under the Equity Distribution Agreements or make additional
supplemental payments to ensure that the sales price per share of any Shares sold in the offering will not be less than the Company’s
then-current net asset value per share. Any such payments made by the Adviser will not be subject to reimbursement by the Company.
Although the Company has filed the Prospectus Supplement with the SEC,
the Company has no obligation to sell any Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreements, and may at any time suspend the offering of
Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreements. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from
time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Shares and determinations by the Company of its need
for, and the appropriate sources of, additional capital.
The foregoing description is a summary of the material provisions of
the Equity Distribution Agreements and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the Form of Equity Distribution Agreements, filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.
A copy of the opinion of Miles & Stockbridge P.C., relating to
the legality of the issuance and sale of the Shares pursuant to the Prospectus is attached as Exhibit 5.1 hereto.
This Current Report on Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell
or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which
such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state
or other jurisdiction.

On May 9, 2025, TXNM Energy, Inc., Public Service Company of New Mexico, and Texas-New Mexico Power Company (collectively, the “Company”) issued a press release announcing results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025.  The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The Company's press release and other communications from time to time may include certain financial measures that are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""GAAP"").  A “non-GAAP financial measure” is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the company's financial statements.
Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations, on an ongoing basis, of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, other income and deductions, earnings, and earnings per share.  The Company uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per diluted share (or ongoing diluted earnings per share) to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including  those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees.  Certain non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company exclude the impact of net unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedges, the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, pension expense related to previously disposed of gas distribution business, and certain non-recurring, infrequent, and other items.  The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations.  Management also believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is largely consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures with respect to prior periods.
The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company uses ongoing earnings guidance to provide investors with management's expectations of ongoing financial performance over the period presented.  While the Company believes ongoing earnings guidance is an appropriate measure, it is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP.  The Company does not intend for ongoing earnings guidance to represent an expectation of net earnings as defined by GAAP.  Since the future differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings are frequently outside the control of the Company, management is generally not able to estimate the impact of the reconciling items between forecasted GAAP earnings and ongoing earnings guidance, nor their probable impact on GAAP earnings without unreasonable effort; therefore, management is generally not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for forecasted ongoing earnings guidance.  Reconciling items may include revenues and expenses resulting from transactions that do not occur in the normal course of the Company's business operations, as well as net unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedges, the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, and pension expense related to previously disposed of gas distribution business as discussed above.

As previously disclosed, on December 22, 2024,
Nordstrom, Inc., a Washington corporation (“Nordstrom”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) with Norse Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Navy Acquisition
Co. Inc., a Washington corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Acquisition Sub”). The
Merger Agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Sub will merge with and
into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
On April 10, 2025, Nordstrom filed its definitive
proxy statement on Schedule 14A (as it may be supplemented from time to time, the “Definitive Proxy Statement”)
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) with respect to the Company’s special meeting
of shareholders (the “Special Meeting”) to be held in connection with transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. The Special Meeting is scheduled to be held on May 16, 2025 at 9:00 AM Pacific Time.
Explanatory Note
As previously disclosed in the Definitive Proxy
Statement, on March 31, 2025, a Nordstrom shareholder filed a purported class action complaint relating to the Merger in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Washington against Nordstrom, Parent, Acquisition Sub, Liverpool, and the members of the Nordstrom
Board, which is captioned Gilbert v. Nordstrom, Inc. et al., No. 2:25-cv-00568 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 31, 2025) (the “Gilbert Complaint”).
Additional information about the legal proceedings related to the Gilbert Complaint are set forth below under the heading “Litigation
Relating to the Merger.”Additionally, Nordstrom has received 15 letters
(the “Shareholder Letters”) from certain purported shareholders of Nordstrom claiming certain allegedly material
omissions in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Nordstrom believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy
Statement under applicable law. However, to avoid the risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk that lawsuits may delay
or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the proposed Merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, Nordstrom
wishes to make supplemental disclosures related to the proposed Merger, which are set forth below under the heading “Supplementary
Disclosures,” in response to the Shareholder Letters. Nothing in such supplemental disclosures shall be deemed an admission of liability
or the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosures set forth therein.
All paragraph headings and page references used
herein refer to the headings and pages in the Definitive Proxy Statement before any additions or deletions resulting from the supplementary
disclosures set forth herein or any other amendments or supplements, and certain capitalized terms used below, unless otherwise defined,
have the meanings set forth in the Definitive Proxy Statement. The supplemental information is identified below by
bold underlined
text.
Stricken-through
shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Definitive Proxy
Statement. Except as described herein, the information provided in the Definitive Proxy Statement continues to apply. To the extent that
information herein differs from or conflicts with information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information set forth herein
shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement.
Litigation Relating to the Merger
The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Litigation Relating to the Merger” is hereby amended and supplemented by
making the following changes on pages 125-126 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:
On March 31, 2025, a Nordstrom shareholder filed
a purported class action complaint relating to the Merger in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington
(the“Court”)
against Nordstrom, Parent, Acquisition Sub, Liverpool, and the members of the Nordstrom Board, which
is captioned Gilbert v. Nordstrom, Inc. et al., No. 2:25-cv-00568 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 31, 2025) (the “Gilbert Complaint”).
1
The Gilbert Complaint seeks (i) a declaratory
judgment that the Merger violates the Washington Moratorium Statute because the Merger Proposal is not conditioned on the approval of
holders of two-thirds of Nordstrom’s outstanding shares excluding the shares owned by the Parent Parties, (ii) an injunction preventing
consummation of the Merger unless and until the Merger Proposal is approved by holders of two-thirds of Nordstrom’s outstanding
shares excluding the shares owned by the Parent Parties, (iii) findings that the members of the Board, Parent, Acquisition Sub, and Liverpool
breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger, which the Gilbert Complaint alleges was unfair, and (iv) an award of damages
and other relief.
On
April 4, 2025, the plaintiff filed an Ex Parte Motion to Expedite Briefing for Expedited Discovery, seeking a court order requiring
Nordstrom and other defendants to produce documents and respond to interrogatories in response to the plaintiff’s discovery
materials. Nordstrom and the named independent directors filed a brief in opposition to the plaintiff’  motion
on April 9, 2025, asking the court to deny the plaintiff’s Ex Parte Motion for Expedited Discovery. Also on April 9, 2025,
defendants Parent, Acquisition Sub, Erik B. Nordstrom, and Peter E. Nordstrom filed a brief joining in the arguments made by
Nordstrom and the independent directors in their opposition to the plaintiff’s motion. On April 10, 2025, the plaintiff filed
a reply brief in support of his Ex Parte Motion for Expedited Discovery. On April 11, 2025, the Court denied the plaintiff’s
motion for expedited discovery.
In that same April 11, 2025 Order denying
the plaintiff's motion for expedited discovery, the Court set a briefing schedule should the plaintiff seek to file a motion for preliminary
injunction. On April 18, consistent with the Court's scheduling order, the plaintiff filed his Motion for Preliminary Injunction. In
his motion, the plaintiff requested that the Court (i) delay the May 16, 2025 shareholder vote on the Merger until 20 days after Nordstrom
issues additional proxy disclosures stating that the Merger requires approval by two-thirds of unaffiliated shareholders; and (ii) prohibit
the Merger from closing if that two-thirds approval is not reached.
On April 25, 2025, Nordstrom and the independent
directors filed their Opposition to the Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Also on April 25, Parent, Acquisition Sub,
Liverpool, Erik B. Nordstrom, and Peter E. Nordstrom filed a separate brief opposing the plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
In connection with the briefs filed by the defendants, Eric Sprunk, the Chair of the Special Committee, Erik B. Nordstrom, a member of
the Family Group, and Graciano F. Guichard González, the Chairman of the Board of Liverpool, gave declarations (the “Declarations”),
which are attached hereto (without exhibits) as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, and 99.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Nordstrom
wishes to file the Declarations on this Form 8-K to provide shareholders directly with the same information that was provided to the court.
The filing of the Declarations shall not be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the
disclosures set forth therein.
On May 6, 2025, the Court entered an Order
Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
The filings related to the foregoing legal
proceedings are available on the Court’s docket.
Nordstrom intends to vigorously defend against
the Gilbert Complaint. Additional lawsuits arising out of the Merger may be filed in the future. We cannot assure you as to the outcome
of such lawsuits or the Gilbert Complaint.

SPECIAL FACTORS
Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to the Special Committee
The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to the Special Committee—Public Trading
Comparables Analysis (December Projections)” is hereby amended and supplemented by making the following changes to the third paragraph
of such section beginning on page 73 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:
The AV /
CY2024E Adj. EBITDA and AV / CY2025E Adj. EBITDA multiples for Macy’s, Inc. were calculated as of December 8, 2023 (the last unaffected
date for Macy’s, Inc.’s share price before news of investor interest in an acquisition of Macy’s, Inc.).
Based
on the analysis of the relevant metrics for Nordstrom and each of the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley selected a representative range
of financial multiples for calendar years 2024 and 2025 of 3.5x to 5.0x and applied this range of multiples to Nordstrom’s estimated
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and amortization of developer reimbursements
(“Company Adj. EBITDA”) for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 as set forth in the December Projections, which is referred
to in this proxy statement as “FY2024E Company Adj. EBITDA” for fiscal year 2024, and “FY2025E Company Adj.
EBITDA” for fiscal year 2025. Based on Nordstrom’s number of fully diluted shares outstanding (determined using the treasury
stock method)
of approximately 174.9 million
as of December 20, 2024 and net debt
of approximately $2,292 million
,
which took into account
less
the
$280 million of
publicly disclosed cash received by Nordstrom
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 in connection with the amended program agreement with TD Bank USA, N.A., each as provided by
Nordstrom’s management, Morgan Stanley estimated the implied value per share of Nordstrom Common Stock as of December 20, 2024,
rounded to the nearest $0.25, as follows:

The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to the Special Committee—Discounted
Equity Value Analysis (December Projections)” is hereby amended and supplemented by making the following changes to the second and
third paragraphs of such section beginning on page 74 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:
To calculate the estimated implied values per
share of Nordstrom Common Stock, Morgan Stanley utilized Company Adj. EBITDA for fiscal year 2026 based on the December Projections. Based
upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied a range of AVs to next twelve-month Adj. EBITDA
(“NTM Adj. EBITDA”) multiples (“AV / NTM Adj. EBITDA”) of 3.5x to 5.0x to Nordstrom’s NTM
Adj. EBITDA (“Company NTM Adj. EBITDA”) estimate reflecting fiscal year 2026 based on the December Projections in order
to calculate a range of undiscounted future fully diluted AVs. Morgan Stanley then deducted from such range Nordstrom’s future net
debt
of approximately $1,441 million
, based on the December Projections, to calculate a range of undiscounted future fully
diluted equity values of Nordstrom and added the future value of cumulative dividends.
Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting future
fully diluted equity values to October 31, 2024, at a discount rate of 14.5%, which was selected by Morgan Stanley based on its experience
and professional judgment and based on Nordstrom’s estimated cost of equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method.
Based on Nordstrom’s number of fully diluted shares outstanding
(
determined using the treasury
stock method)
of approximately 174.9 million
as of December 20, 2024, as provided by Nordstrom’s management, Morgan
Stanley calculated a range of estimated implied values per share of Nordstrom Common Stock. The results of this analysis are listed below
rounded to the nearest $0.25:
The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to the Special Committee—Discounted
Cash Flow Analysis (December Projections)” is hereby amended and supplemented by making the following changes to the third paragraph
of such section beginning on page 74 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:
Morgan Stanley then adjusted the resulting range
of aggregate values by deducting net debt
of approximately $2,292 million
, as provided by Nordstrom’s management.
To calculate the range of estimated implied values per share of Nordstrom Common Stock, Morgan Stanley divided the resulting range of
equity values by Nordstrom’s number of fully diluted shares outstanding (determined using the treasury stock method)
of approximately
174.9 million
as of December 20, 2024, as provided by Nordstrom’s management. The results of this analysis are listed below
rounded to the nearest $0.25:
The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to the Special Committee—Equity Research
Analyst Price Targets” is hereby amended and supplemented by making the following changes to the first paragraph of such section
beginning on page 75 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:
Morgan Stanley reviewed and analyzed select future
public market trading price targets for Nordstrom Common Stock, prepared and published by equity research analysts as of December 20,
2024. These targets reflect each analyst’s undiscounted estimate of the future public market trading price of Nordstrom Common Stock.
The range of equity analyst price targets for Nordstrom was $14.50 to $26.00 per share
, with a median and mean price target per
share of $23.00 and $22.65, respectively
. Morgan Stanley, based on its professional judgment and experience, did not include in
its analysis an analyst price target of $38.50 or brokers with revised price targets based on transaction-related news. Morgan Stanley
then discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for Nordstrom Common Stock at a discount rate of 14.5%, which was the discount
rate selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to reflect Nordstrom’s cost of
equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method, to arrive at a range of $12.75 to $22.75 per share, rounded to the nearest
$0.25
, with a median and mean price target per share of $20.09 and $19.79, respectively
.

Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC to the Special Committee
The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC to the Special Committee—Selected Public
Comparable Company Analysis to the Special Committee” is hereby amended and supplemented by making the following changes to the
fourth paragraph of such section beginning on page 83 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:
Based on this analysis and other considerations
that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and experience, related to, among other things, differences in the business,
financial and operating characteristics, and prospects of Nordstrom and the companies included in the selected public company analysis,
Centerview selected a reference range of AV to Adj. EBITDA multiples of 4.0x to 5.0x for fiscal years 2024 and 2025. Centerview applied
this reference range of multiples to Nordstrom’s estimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
of intangible assets and amortization of developer reimbursements (“Company Adj. EBITDA”) for fiscal years 2024 and

N.A., as provided by the management of Nordstrom, and as included in the Internal Data. Centerview divided the results of the foregoing
calculations by Nordstrom’s number of fully-diluted outstanding shares of Nordstrom Common Stock (determined using the treasury
stock method and based on the Internal Data)
of approximately 174.9 million
as of December 20, 2024. This analysis resulted
in a range of estimated implied values per share for Nordstrom Common Stock of $14.60 to $21.05, rounded to the nearest $0.05, for fiscal
year 2024. The analysis resulted in a range of estimated implied values per share for Nordstrom Common Stock of $17.75 to $25.00, rounded
to the nearest $0.05, for fiscal year 2025. Centerview then compared the results of the above analysis to the Merger Consideration of
$24.25 per share to be paid to the holders of shares of Nordstrom Common Stock (other than the excluded shares described in Centerview’s
opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC to the Special Committee — Discounted
Cash Flow Analysis” is hereby amended and supplemented by making the following changes to the second paragraph of such section beginning
on page 83 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:
In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated
a range of equity values for Nordstrom Common Stock by (a) discounting to present value, as of Nordstrom’s third fiscal quarter
balance sheet date of November 2, 2024, using discount rates ranging from 11% to 13% (reflecting Centerview’s analysis of Nordstrom’s
weighted average cost of capital determined using the capital asset pricing model and based on considerations that Centerview deemed relevant
in its professional judgment and experience), and the mid-year convention: (i) the forecasted unlevered free cash flows of Nordstrom over
the period beginning on November 3, 2024 and ending on February 3, 2029, utilized by Centerview based on the December Projections, and
(ii) a range of implied terminal values of Nordstrom, calculated by Centerview by applying perpetuity growth rates between 1.5% to 2.5%,
and (b) subtracting from the foregoing results Nordstrom’s net debt
of approximately $2,292 million
,
as of
November 2, 2024
, as set forth in the Internal Data. Centerview divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the number
of fully-diluted outstanding shares of Nordstrom Common Stock (determined using the treasury stock method and based on the Internal Data)
of approximately 174.9 million
as of December 20, 2024. This resulted in a range of estimated implied values per share for
Nordstrom Common Stock of approximately $21.00 to $30.80, rounded to the nearest $0.10. Centerview then compared the results of the above
analysis to the Merger Consideration of $24.25 per share to be paid to the holders of shares of Nordstrom Common Stock (other than the
excluded shares described in Centerview’s opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC to the Special Committee — Other Factors”is hereby amended and supplemented by making the following changes to the second bullet of such section beginning on page 84 of the Definitive
Proxy Statement:
Analyst Price Target Analysis.
Centerview
reviewed stock price targets for Nordstrom Common Stock in Wall Street research analyst reports publicly available as of December 20,
2024 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and delivery of Centerview’s
opinion), which indicated low and high price targets ranging from $14.50 to $26.00 per share, rounded to the nearest $0.05
, with
a median and mean price target per share of $23.00 and $22.65, respectively
. Centerview, based on its experience and professional
judgment, did not include in its analysis an analyst price target of $38.50 or brokers with revised price targets based on transaction-related
news.
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information—2023 Projections” is hereby
amended and supplemented by making the following changes to the second paragraph of such section beginning on page 101 of the Definitive
Proxy Statement:
5
Although the information in the 2023 Projections
is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous estimates and assumptions made by Nordstrom management with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific
to Nordstrom’s business, in each case as of the date it was prepared, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately
and many of which are beyond Nordstrom’s control. The 2023 Projections include the following assumptions and estimates, among others:·Net sales growth rates ranging from 1% to 3% annually;·Credit card revenues as a rate of sales ranging from 3.3% to 3.4%;·Opening 20 new Nordstrom Rack Stores in 2024 and 25 new Nordstrom Rack Stores in both 2025 and 2026;·Gross margin
improvement
improving from 43.7% in 2024 to 44.4% in 2026,
driven by inventory management, shrink and Nordstrom Product Group penetration;·Variable
expenses held steady
expense holding at 18.4% from 2024 through 2026,
driven by supply chain and radio frequency identification (RFID) efficiencies;·Fixed expense leverage
of 20 basis points
held steady
from 2024 to 2026;·Capital expenditures reflecting investments at 3% to 4% of sales
to fuel Nordstrom Rack store expansion
while maintaining focus on digital and supply chain enablement; and·Extrapolation of fiscal years 2027 and 2028 from fiscal year 2026.
The disclosure under the section of the Definitive
Proxy Statement captioned “Special Factors—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information—August 2024 Projections”is hereby amended and supplemented by making the following changes to the second paragraph of the section beginning on page 102 of the
Definitive Proxy Statement:
Although the information in the August Projections
is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous estimates and assumptions made by Nordstrom management with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, and other future events, as well as matters specific
to Nordstrom’s business, in each case as of the date it was prepared, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately
and many of which are beyond Nordstrom’s control. The August Projections include the same assumptions and estimates as the 2023
Projections, except for the following, among others:·Changes to 2024 based on actual results through the second fiscal quarter and projected results for the
third and fourth fiscal quarter of 2024;·Increased net sales growth rates to 4% in fiscal years 2027 and 2028, driven by the compounding impact
of new Nordstrom Rack stores;·Credit card revenues as a rate of sales ranging from 3.2% to 3.3%, which is a slight reduction from
the 2023 Projections to reflect macro pressures and 2024 actuals;·Opening 23 new stores in fiscal year 2024 and 25 new Nordstrom Rack Stores per year from fiscal year 2025
through fiscal year 2028;·Improvement in EBIT margin in fiscal years 2027 and 2028 primarily driven by sales leverage;·Lower D&A due to reduced capex and write offs causing improvement in EBIT in fiscal years 2027 and
2028 and EBITDA reduced or held flat to the 2023 Projections; and·Capital expenditures reflecting investments at approximately 3% of sales, reflecting reduced technology
spend.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
These Definitive Additional Materials, the documents
to which Nordstrom refers you in these Definitive Additional Materials and information included in oral statements or other written statements
made or to be made by Nordstrom or on Nordstrom’s behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or
exclusively relate to historical facts, including, without limitation statements relating to the completion of the Merger. Forward-looking
statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly
relate to any historical or current fact. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as“may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “future,”“will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,”“estimate,” “intend,” “target,” “plan,” “projection,” “would”and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or phrases or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking
nature, but the absence of these words does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. Nordstrom’s shareholders are cautioned
that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and
that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect Nordstrom’s
good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations but are not guarantees of future performance or events. Nordstrom undertakes no obligation
to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, except as may be required by law. These
risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in Nordstrom’s filings with the SEC, including in our
most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in these Definitive Additional
Materials, and the following factors:·uncertainties related to the consummation of the Merger;·the fact that the Special Dividend is contingent upon conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and
may not be paid;
7·our ability to complete the Merger, if at all, on the anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining
the Requisite Shareholder Approvals and regulatory approvals, the absence of a Below Investment Grade Rating Event and the satisfaction
of other conditions to the completion of the Merger;·unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Merger;·our obligation to pay a termination fee under certain circumstances if the Merger is terminated;·the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on the plans, business relationships, operating
results and operations of Nordstrom;·uncertainties about the pendency of the Merger and the effect of the Merger on employees, customers and
other third parties who deal with Nordstrom;·the impact of certain interim covenants that we are subject to under the Merger Agreement;·provisions in the Merger Agreement that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, which
might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Nordstrom from considering or proposing
that acquisition;·the fact that if Parent is required to pay a reverse termination fee in accordance with the Merger Agreement,
the Family Guarantors may be required to and Liverpool may opt to sell substantial amounts of their shares of Nordstrom Common Stock in
order to satisfy their ratable portion of the reverse termination fee liabilities, which could adversely impact the trading price of Nordstrom’s
Common Stock;·the fact that we and our directors and officers may be subject to lawsuits relating to the Merger;·the outcome of any lawsuits, regulatory proceedings or enforcement matters that may be instituted against
Nordstrom, the Parent Parties or others relating to the Merger Agreement;·the substantial transaction-related costs we will continue to incur in connection with the Merger;·our efforts to complete the Merger could disrupt our relationships with third parties and employees, divert
management’s attention, or result in negative publicity or legal proceedings;·the inability of shareholders (excluding the Family Group and Liverpool) to participate in any further
upside of Nordstrom’s business if the Merger is consummated;·our ability to retain and hire key personnel;·competitive responses to the Merger;·continued availability of capital and financing and rating agency actions;·risks regarding the failure to obtain the necessary financing or have a sufficient amount of cash on hand
to complete the Merger or pay the full amount of the Special Dividend;·the impact of a potential Below Investment Grade Rating Event;·legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting our business;·general economic and market developments and conditions;·unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including but not limited to acts of terrorism,
pandemics, outbreaks of war or hostilities, as well as our response to any of the aforementioned factors;
8·the fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Nordstrom Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and·the risk that Nordstrom’s stock price may fluctuate during the pendency of the Merger and may decline
significantly if the Merger is not consummated.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements
that Nordstrom makes in this these Definitive Additional Materials are qualified by the information contained or incorporated by reference
in these Definitive Additional Materials, including: (1) the information contained under this caption, and (2) information in Nordstrom’s
most recent filings on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, including the information contained under the caption “Risk Factors,” and
information in its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. While the list of factors presented here is considered representative,
no such list should be considered a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant
additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with
those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial
loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material impact on our financial condition, results
of operations, credit rating or liquidity.
The forward-looking statements in these Definitive
Additional Materials are based upon information available to us as of the date of these Definitive Additional Materials, and while we
believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements
should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information.
These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.
You should read these Definitive Additional Materials
and the documents that we reference and have filed as exhibits to these Definitive Additional Materials with the understanding that our
actual future results, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking
statements by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of these Definitive Additional Materials.
Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in these Definitive
Additional Materials, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise. Nordstrom’s shareholders are advised
to consult any future disclosures that Nordstrom makes on related subjects as may be detailed in its other filings made from time to time
with the SEC.

special cash dividend (the “Special Dividend”) to holders of the Company’s common stock, no par value
per share (the “Company Common Stock”), contingent upon the occurrence of the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”)
and payable to shareholders of record as of a date that is no later than one trading day prior to the effective time of the Merger (the“Effective Time”) in an amount equal to (a) $0.25 per share or (b) if such amount would result in the
Company Cash on Hand (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time being less than $410 million
after giving effect to the Special Dividend Payment (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
,
the
greatest amount per share of Company Common Stock less than $0.25 that would result in there being $410 million in Company Cash on Hand

the “Dividends”) to holders of the Company Common Stock contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing and payable
to shareholders of record as of a date that is no later than one trading day prior to the Effective Time in an amount equal to the product
of (a) the number of days from the record date for payment of the last quarterly dividend paid by the Company prior to the Effective
Time through and including immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) a daily dividend rate determined by dividing the amount of
the last quarterly dividend prior to the Effective Time by 91 (such amount, the “Calculated Stub Period Dividend Amount”).
On May 9, 2025, the Company announced that the
Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has fixed May 19, 2025 as the record date for determining the
holders of the Company Common Stock entitled to be paid the Dividends, if the Dividends are declared by the Board. As of the date hereof,
the Board has not declared the Dividends or fixed the amount of the Dividends or their payment date.
In order to be paid the Dividends, if declared,
holders of the Company Common Stock must hold their shares as of immediately prior to Closing. The amount of the Dividends and the payment
date of the Dividends, if declared, will be disclosed by the Company prior to the Closing.
The Closing is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of certain conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by the requisite percentage of Company Common Stock at the Special
Meeting of Shareholders of the Company called for May 16, 2025. The Company cannot assure you that the Dividends will be declared by the
Board or, if declared, what their amount will be or whether they will be paid.

PriceSmart, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PriceSmart” or the “Company”), today announced the appointment of Gualberto Hernandez as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective June 1, 2025.
PriceSmart’s current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Michael McCleary resigned by mutual agreement with the Company, but will continue to serve as an Executive Vice President of the Company through September 30, 2025.
Thereafter, Mr. McCleary has agreed to provide consulting support of up to 40 hours per month for three months following his resignation.
Mr. Hernandez has served as Vice President Finance & Strategy for Latin America for The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. since January 2016.
During that tenure, he also served as Vice President and General Manager for Latin America for La Mer, an Estee Lauder Companies’ brand, from 2020 to 2023 and since July 2024 as Vice President Finance for Emerging Markets.
Prior to Estée Lauder, Mr. Hernandez served as Chief Operating Officer (Finance and Operations) Latin America for Sephora from November 2013 to January 2016.
Mr. Hernandez received a B.A. in accountancy from Universidad Nacional de Litoral and an MBA from Universidad del CEMA.
Mr. Hernandez is 61 years old.
There is no arrangement or understanding pursuant to which Mr. Hernandez was appointed as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There are no related party transactions between the Company and Mr. Hernandez that are reportable under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
(e)
Upon commencement of his employment, Mr. Hernandez will receive (i) an annual base salary of $720,000; (ii) participation in the Company’s annual incentive program (with an annual target bonus opportunity of $180,000); (iii) a stock award having an initial value equal to $4,500,000, with an annual vesting targeted at $900,000 per year; (iv) a cash sign-on bonus of $150,000; and (v) relocation benefits.
The sign-on bonus is subject to forfeiture, in whole or in part, under certain circumstances if Mr. Hernandez does not complete two years of employment.
Mr. Hernandez’s initial stock award, which is anticipated to be made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, will include an additional prorated amount based on time served in the position during the last three months of fiscal year 2025.
Mr. Hernandez’s initial stock award will consist entirely of time-vesting restricted stock awards (RSAs) for the first four years of vesting and 50% RSA and 50% performance stock units (PSUs) for the fifth year of vesting.
The performance component of the PSUs will be achieved based on the Company’s actual performance for fiscal year 2026 compared to metrics that will be established by the Compensation Committee for fiscal year 2026, but the PSUs will not vest until the continued service component of vesting has been achieved at the end of the fifth year of vesting (unless accelerated in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Amended and Restated 2013 Equity Incentive Award Plan, as amended, and the applicable award agreements).
The Company and Mr. Hernandez have entered into an Employment Agreement with an effective date of June 1, 2025. The Employment Agreement provides for a one-year term, which will be automatically renewed for an additional one-year term, unless either the Company or Mr. Hernandez provides at least 60 days’ notice that the Company or Mr. Hernandez, as the case may be, wishes to terminate the agreement.
The Employment Agreement specifies a base salary amount of $720,000, which may be increased, but not decreased, at the Company’s discretion.
The Employment Agreement states that Mr. Hernandez is eligible to participate in any bonus plan and to receive all other benefits offered to senior executives of the Company under the Company’s benefit practices and plans.
In addition to termination at the end of the term, Mr. Hernandez may terminate his employment on 60 days’ prior written notice. The Company may terminate Mr. Hernandez’s employment with cause upon immediate notice or without cause upon 30 days’ prior written notice. In the event that (i) the Company terminates Mr. Hernandez’s employment without “cause”; (ii) upon termination due to an executive’s “disability”; (iii) Mr. Hernandez terminates his employment for “good reason”; or (iv) the Company elects to cause the non-renewal of the employment agreement such that it expires at the end of its then-current term, subject to Mr. Hernandez providing a release to the Company, Mr. Hernandez will be entitled to:•payment of an amount equal to one times his base salary then in effect, payable in 24 equal installments over a period of 12 months,•continued contribution of the premium cost for Mr. Hernandez’s and his eligible dependents’ participation in the Company’s group health plan for 12 months,•payment of any accrued but any unpaid bonus for the year prior to termination and a pro rata bonus earned for the year of termination (payable when all other bonuses are paid), and•accelerated vesting of the number of shares subject to outstanding and unvested equity awards held by Mr. Hernandez scheduled to vest in the 12-month period following his termination; provided that as to an award that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements, (i) vesting will remain subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance criteria, and vesting will not occur unless and until the applicable performance criteria are determined to have been met, and (ii) Mr. Hernandez will not be eligible for any increases in the number of shares covered by awards subject to performance-based vesting based on corporate performance above target levels.
Upon termination of the employment agreement by reason of Mr. Hernandez’s death, Mr. Hernandez’s estate will be entitled to receive continued contribution of the premium cost for his eligible dependents’ participation in the Company’s group health plan for 12 months and payment of any accrued but any unpaid bonus for any year prior to termination and a pro rata bonus for the year of termination (payable when all other bonuses are paid).
Mr. Hernandez’s employment agreement also contains confidentiality provisions, restrictions on solicitation of employees and interference with the Company’s customers and contracts, and other terms and conditions customary to executive employment agreements.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the Employment Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
The Company issued a press release on May 9, 2025 announcing Mr. Hernandez’s appointment, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
On May 8, 2025, the Company and Mr. McCleary entered into a Separation Agreement with Waiver and Release of Claims (the “Separation Agreement”) detailing the terms of his separation from the Company. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, and in consideration of Mr. McCleary’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of the Company and his agreement to abide by certain restrictive covenants, Mr. McCleary will receive severance equal to $721,000, payable pursuant to the Company’s regular payroll schedule over a period of one year; an annual cash incentive of up to (but in no event to exceed) $180,250, subject to the Company’s achievement of previously established corporate performance metrics for fiscal year 2025; in lieu of a prorated annual cash incentive for fiscal year 2026, a payment of $15,021, representing 1/12
th
of his target bonus for fiscal year 2025; and contribution by the Company of the Company’s portion of the premium cost of Mr. McCleary’s participation and that of his eligible dependents in the Company’s group health plan for a period of 18 months following termination of his employment or until he has secured other employment, whichever occurs first.
In addition, subject to Mr. McCleary’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of the Company and his continuing to provide the transition support and abide by certain restrictive covenants, Mr. McCleary will retain, and will be eligible to continue vesting in, restricted stock awards and performance stock units covering a total of 12,074 shares of the Company’s common stock through the applicable vesting dates.
Mr. McCleary also will be entitled to receive the dividend equivalents for fiscal year 2025 with respect to performance stock units granted in September 2024 for which the applicable performance criteria will be measured in October 2025. During the term of the Separation Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following the later of the last severance payment by the Company to Mr. McCleary pursuant to the Separation Agreement and the last vesting of equity incentive awards, Mr. McCleary will be subject to customary customer and supplier non-solicitation and employee non-solicitation restrictions.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the Separation Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

On April 7, 2025, Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) furnished a proxy statement (the “Proxy Statement”) to its stockholders for the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 19, 2025, including a proposal to approve an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) to increase the number of shares available for grant under the Plan by 2,000,000 shares (the “Amendment”).  The Amendment is Proposal 3 in the Proxy Statement (“Proposal 3”).
Today, the Company is providing supplemental information to help shareholders and proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”), in evaluating Proposal 3.  Specifically, the Company is providing updated information regarding the shares available under the Plan as of March 31, 2025 (115,255), which as the result of our annual grants made in the first quarter of 2025 is significantly less than the number of shares available under the Plan as of December 31, 2024 (1,000,329).  ISS’s initial recommendation on Proposal 3 was based on the shares remaining available for issuance under the Plan as of December 31, 2024.  Using the number of shares available as of March 31, 2025 is more current and results in lower cost of Plan assessments, including dilution and Shareholder Value Transfer.
The Company provides the following information:
Number of Shares Available for Grant under the Plan
:
As of March 31, 2025, 115,255 shares remained reserved and available for issuance with respect to new awards under the Plan.   The Plan does not include any fungible share counting provisions.
Number of Awards Outstanding
:
As of March 31, 2025, the following awards were outstanding under the Plan:
(i)  options with respect to 30,000 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $20.67 and a weighted average remaining term of 0.87 years, and
(ii) full value awards with respect to 2,504,097 shares.
As of March 31, 2025, there were no unvested shares issued in lieu of cash compensation. Company RSUs are settled with Company stock.
Common Stock Outstanding
:
As of March 31, 2025, total common stock outstanding was 97,069,001 shares.
Overhang
:
As of March 31, 2025, 2,537,701 shares were subject to outstanding Company awards (33,604 options, 1,978,201 restricted shares, and 525,896 performance-based RSUs), resulting in an overhang of approximately 2.66%. If an additional 2,000,000 shares are reserved for issuance under the Plan, the overhang would be approximately 4.57%."

Following the annual meeting, the board considered the results of stockholders’ advisory vote regarding the future frequency of “say on pay” advisory votes. Considering that a large majority of stockholders supported holding these votes annually, a result consistent with the board's recommendation, the board determined that the Company will hold future say on pay advisory votes at each annual meeting of stockholders. The next say on pay advisory vote will therefore occur at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2026. The next advisory vote regarding the frequency of future say on pay advisory votes will occur no later than the Company’s 2031 annual meeting.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 7, 2025, NovaGold Resources Inc. (the “Company”) entered
into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and RBC Capital Markets,
LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters listed on Schedule II thereto (the “Underwriters”), related to a public
offering (the “Offering”) of 47,850,000 of the Company’s common shares
.
In addition, the Company granted the Underwriters an option exercisable for
30 days from the date of the Underwriting Agreement to purchase up to 7,177,500 of additional common shares of the Company.
The net proceeds from the Offering are expected to be approximately
$169.7 million, or approximately $195.2 million if the option is exercised in full by the Underwriters, after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use
the net proceeds from this Offering to fund the Company’s obligation to purchase certain membership interests under the
Acquisition Agreement dated April 22, 2025, and to use the remaining net proceeds, if any, for general corporate purposes including
updating the feasibility study. The Offering is expected to close on May 9, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.
The Company made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants
concerning the Company and the registration statement in the Underwriting Agreement and also agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Offering
is being made pursuant to the Company’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-286696), filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) and declared effective on April 23, 2025, as supplemented by a prospectus
supplement dated May 7, 2025. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy
any of the securities described herein.
Concurrently with the Offering, the
Company entered into a concurrent private placement offering (the “Concurrent Private Placement”) of 17,173,853 common
shares at a price equal to the public offering price for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $64.4 million with two of our
major investors, including Electrum Strategic Resources L.P. and Kopernick Global Investors, LLC (each a ""Placement Investor""). The
Company entered into a Subscription Agreement dated May 7, 2025 (the “Subscription Agreement”) with each of the
Placement Investors setting out the terms of the Concurrent Private Placement, which is expected to include similar resale
registration rights as currently contained in the Backstop Agreement the Company entered into on April 22, 2025. The Company
anticipates using the net proceeds of the Concurrent Private Placement for the same purposes as the Offering. The closing of the
Concurrent Private Placement is expected to close at the same time or shortly after the Offering. The consummation of the Offering
is not contingent upon the consummation of the Concurrent Private Placement, and the consummation of the Concurrent Private
Placement is not contingent upon the consummation of the Offering.
The foregoing description of certain terms of the Underwriting Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text
of the Underwriting Agreement which is attached as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. A copy of the opinion of
Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP is filed as Exhibit 5.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

The amendment and restatement of the Company’s Flexible Stock Plan (the “Plan”) was approved by shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held May 7, 2025. The Plan provides for the award of stock-based and other benefits (including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units, cash and equity performance awards, other stock-based awards and other awards) to attract and retain valuable employees, directors and other key individuals, align the interests of participants with the interests of shareholders, and reward outstanding performance.

The amendments to the Plan included:
(a)
increasing the number of shares available for future grant under the Plan by 5.0 million. After the amendment, as of March 7, 2025, there was a total of approximately 6.5 million shares available for future grant under the Plan (excluding forfeitures of existing awards that again become available for issuance under the Plan);
(b)
extending the term of the Plan by one year to May 7, 2035;
(c)
allowing for the crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested awards, but prohibiting the payment of such dividends (or additional awards resulting from dividend equivalents) until such time the underlying awards become vested;

of the number of shares to be issued, the dates on which such sales are anticipated to be made, any limitation on the number of shares
that may be sold in one day, any minimum price below which sales may not be made and other sales parameters as the Company deems appropriate.

Forward Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Such forward-looking statements include statements concerning anticipated future events and expectations that are not historical facts. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “plan,” “believe,” “goal,” “target,” “aim,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “outlook,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “seek,” “continue,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “possible,” “potential,” “strategy,” “opportunity,” “predict,” “should,” “would” and other similar words and expressions, although the absence of these words or expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations and beliefs of TeraWulf’s management and are inherently subject to a number of factors, risks, uncertainties and assumptions and their potential effects. There can be no assurance that future developments will be those that have been anticipated. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements based on a number of factors, risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among others: (1) the ability to mine bitcoin profitably; (2) our ability to attract additional customers to lease our HPC data centers; (3) our ability to perform under our existing data center lease agreements (4) changes in applicable laws, regulations and/or permits affecting TeraWulf’s operations or the
industries in which it operates; (5) the ability to implement certain business objectives, including its bitcoin mining and HPC data center development, and to timely and cost-effectively execute related projects; (6) failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and/or on acceptable terms with regard to expansion or existing operations; (7) adverse geopolitical or economic conditions, including a high inflationary environment, the implementation of new tariffs and more restrictive trade regulations; (8) the potential of cybercrime, money-laundering, malware infections and phishing and/or loss and interference as a result of equipment malfunction or break-down, physical disaster, data security breach, computer malfunction or sabotage (and the costs associated with any of the foregoing); (9) the availability and cost of power as well as electrical infrastructure equipment necessary to maintain and grow the business and operations of TeraWulf; and (10) other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Potential investors, stockholders and other readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they were made. TeraWulf does not assume any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement after it was made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or regulation. Investors are referred to the full discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and the discussion of risk factors contained in the Company’s filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov."

Recommendation”) comprised solely of independent and disinterested directors that was established by the Board to review, evaluate and negotiate the Merger Agreement and  make a determination as to whether the Transactions are advisable, fair to“unaffiliated security holders” (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act) of the Company and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and make a recommendation to the Board with respect to the Transactions.
Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Corporation will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, collectively, the “Transactions”), with Company surviving the Merger, collectively owned, directly or indirectly, by (i) BCP FC Aggregator L.P., (ii) The Maddock 2015 Irrevocable Trust, The Bryce Maddock Family

As a result of the Merger, each share of Class A Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and Class B Common Stock of the
Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class B Common Stock” and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Company Common Stock”) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) (other than (i) each
share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which shall automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof; (ii) each share (a) owned by the Merger Corporation, any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Merger Corporation or the Continuing Stockholders or, to the extent designated in writing by the Merger Corporation to the Company at least five business days prior to the Effective Time, any
affiliate of the Merger Corporation or (b) in respect of which the holder thereof, the Merger Corporation and, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals (as defined below), the Company (acting at the direction of the Special
Committee) have agreed following the date of the Merger Agreement that such shares will not be cancelled, which shall remain outstanding; and (iii) shares owned by stockholders of the Company who properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware
law) will, at the Effective Time, automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive $16.50 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”), without interest.
Treatment of Equity Awards
Unless otherwise agreed between individual holders and the Merger Corporation, at the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit subject to service-based vesting
conditions granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (each, a “Company RSU”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and is either (a) held by a non-employee member of the Board (whether
vested or unvested) or (b) vested but not yet settled as of the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total
number of shares underlying such Company RSU, by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject to any required withholding of taxes (the “RSU Consideration”), payable, without interest, on the next payroll date that is at least five business days after the
date on which the Merger closes. Each Company RSU that is not vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof and subject to the same terms
and conditions as were applicable to the underlying RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for terms rendered inoperative due to the Merger or for such other administrative or ministerial changes).

conditions granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (each, a “Company PSU”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for which the applicable performance period is completed in accordance with its terms but not yet settled
as of the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares underlying such Company PSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time, based on actual achievement of applicable performance goals as reasonably determined by the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board prior to the closing of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the
applicable award agreement by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject to any required withholding of taxes (the “PSU Consideration”), payable, without interest, on the next payroll date that is at least five business days after the date on which the
Merger closes. Each Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for which the applicable performance period is not complete will remain outstanding without any cash payment or other consideration being made in
respect thereof and remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for terms rendered inoperative due to the Merger, including performance conditions
inapplicable due to the Company no longer being listed on NASDAQ, or for such other administrative or ministerial changes).
Unless otherwise agreed between individual holders and the Merger Corporation, at the Effective Time, each stock option to acquire shares granted pursuant to a Company
Stock Plan (each, a “Company Option”) that is vested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (a) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of such Company Option, by (b) the total number of shares underlying such Company Option, subject to any required withholding of
taxes, payable, without interest, on the next payroll date that is at least five business days after the date on which the Merger closes. Any Company Option that is not vested at the Effective Time will remain outstanding without any cash payment
or other consideration being made in respect thereof and subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for terms rendered inoperative due to the Merger
or for such other administrative or ministerial changes). Any Company Option (vested or unvested) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be
canceled for no consideration.

and warranties (subject to certain materiality qualifiers); (v) the other party’s compliance in all material respects with its pre-closing covenants; and (vi) no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) having occurred since the

or which would reasonably be expected to lead to the submission of, any acquisition proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information in
connection with, any acquisition proposal, (iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement relating to any acquisition proposal or that would

provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in discussions or negotiations with, third parties with respect to an acquisition proposal if the Company complied with certain notice and other requirements and the Board (acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith (in each case after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors), taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such acquisition proposal, that such acquisition proposal would be more favorable to the Company’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and is reasonably capable of being consummated, subject to certain
matching rights in favor of the Merger Corporation (a “Superior Proposal”), or (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal.
Termination and Fees
Either the Company, acting with the prior approval of the Special Committee, or the Merger Corporation, may terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances,

(acting with the prior approval of the Special Committee) and the Merger Corporation, (ii) a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law permanently prohibiting or making illegal
the Merger, (iii) the other party breaches its representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement, subject in certain cases to the right of the breaching party to cure the breach, or (iv) the Company Stockholder Approvals are not
obtained at the stockholders meeting convened therefor; provided that the Merger Corporation shall not be permitted to exercise such right if any of the Continuing Stockholders are then in breach of their respective Voting Agreement (as defined
below) in any material respect. In addition, the Company, acting with the prior approval of the Special Committee, may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger Corporation fails to consummate the closing after the Company has delivered written
notice that all conditions to closing have been satisfied and the Company is prepared to consummate the closing. The Merger Corporation and the Company (acting with the prior approval of the Special Committee) may also terminate the Merger
Agreement by mutual written consent.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including in connection with the Company’s entry into a Superior Proposal, the Company would be required
to pay the Merger Corporation a termination fee of $39,000,000.

to the Company, covenants (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course during the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and (ii) not to engage in specified types of transactions or take
specified actions during this period unless agreed to in writing by the Merger Corporation. The parties have also agreed to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable, including taking all

aside cash pursuant to escrow or other segregation arrangements to fund the Merger Consideration, subject to certain limitations and exceptions.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement,
a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Merger Agreement has been included to provide Company stockholders and other security holders with information regarding its terms and is not
intended to provide any factual information about the Company, the Merger Corporation or their respective affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the purposes of the
Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; are not intended as statements of fact to be relied upon by Company stockholders or other security holders, but rather as a way of
allocating the risk between the parties in the event the statements therein prove to be inaccurate; have been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made between the parties in connection with the negotiation of the
Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement itself; may no longer be true as of a given date; and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by Company
stockholders or other security holders. Company stockholders and other security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, the Merger Corporation or their respective affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date
of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures. The Company acknowledges that, notwithstanding the inclusion of the foregoing cautionary statements, it is responsible for
considering whether additional specific disclosures of material information regarding material contractual provisions are required to make the statements in this Form 8-K not misleading. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone but should
instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Merger Agreement, the Merger, the Company, the Merger Corporation, their respective affiliates and their respective businesses, that will be contained in, or incorporated by
reference into, the proxy statement in preliminary and definitive form and Schedule 13E-3 that the Company will file, as well as in the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, Forms 8-K and other filings that the Company will make, with the SEC.

terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the equity commitment letter, an aggregate equity commitment to fund the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and certain other amounts required to be paid under the Merger Agreement (the“Equity Financing”). The Equity Financing, when funded in full in accordance with the equity commitment letter, will provide an amount that is sufficient to fund the payment of (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration, (ii) any other amounts required
to be paid under Article III of the Merger Agreement and (iii) any fees, costs and expenses of or payable by the Merger Corporation in connection with the Equity Financing at the closing of the Merger.
Voting Agreements
On May 8, 2025, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into Voting and Support Agreements (the “Voting Agreements”)
with each of the Continuing Stockholders, pursuant to which, among other things, the Continuing Stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of Company Common Stock:
(i)

requested by the Board and is required in order to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
(ii)
against any action, agreement or transaction that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of the Company or the Merger Corporation contained in the Merger Agreement;
(iii)
against any action, agreement or transaction that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of the Continuing Stockholders contained in the respective Voting Agreement;
(iv)
against any action, agreement or transaction that would reasonably be expected to otherwise prevent, impede, frustrate or nullify any provision of the Merger Agreement; and
(v)
against any acquisition proposal or other action, agreement or transaction involving the Company that is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere
with, delay, postpone, adversely affect or prevent the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Agreements automatically terminate without any notice or other action by any person upon the earlier of (i) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) the mutual written consent of all of the parties thereto,
(iii) the Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (iv) the Effective Time.
The foregoing description of the Voting Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting

As previously disclosed, on March 9, 2025, Redfin Corporation (“Redfin” or the “Company”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Rocket Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Rocket”), and Neptune Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions therein and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket.
The waiting period with respect to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 8, 2025. The expiration of the HSR Act waiting period satisfies certain conditions to the closing of the Merger. The Merger remains subject to other closing conditions, including approval by Redfin’s stockholders. Assuming the satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, the Merger is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2025.

Other Events
As previously disclosed on December 16, 2024, Berkshire Hills
Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Berkshire”), Commerce Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire (“Merger Sub”) and Brookline Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Brookline”),
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Brookline, with Brookline as the surviving entity
(the “Merger”), and immediately following the Merger, Brookline will merge with and into Berkshire, with Berkshire as the
surviving entity (the “Holdco Merger”). The Merger Agreement further provides that immediately following the Merger, Berkshire
Bank, a Massachusetts trust company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire, Bank Rhode Island, a Rhode Island-chartered bank and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Brookline, and PCSB Bank, a New York savings bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookline, each will merge
with and into Brookline Bank, a Massachusetts trust company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookline, with Brookline Bank as the surviving
bank (the “Bank Mergers” and, together with the Merger and the Holdco Merger, the “Proposed Transaction”).
In connection with the Proposed Transaction, Berkshire filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 24, 2025 a registration statement on Form S-4 containing
a joint proxy statement/prospectus, as amended, and Brookline filed a definitive proxy statement and Berkshire filed a definitive proxy
statement/prospectus with the SEC, dated April 8, 2025 (collectively, the “joint proxy statement/prospectus”), with respect
to the annual meeting of the Berkshire stockholders and the special meeting of the Brookline stockholders scheduled to be held on May 21,
2025, respectively. Berkshire and Brookline first mailed the joint proxy statement/prospectus to their respective stockholders on or about
April 15, 2025.
In
connection with the Proposed Transaction, from April 12, 2025 to May 8, 2025, Berkshire received
four demand letters
and Brookline received nine demand letters from purported Berkshire and Brookline stockholders, respectively (“Demand Letters”),
alleging that the joint proxy statement/prospectus omits material information in violation of federal securities laws and state law disclosure
requirements and demanding that Berkshire and Brookline provide additional disclosures in an amendment or supplement to the joint proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition, on April 29, 2025, a purported individual shareholder of Brookline filed a complaint in New York
state court, captioned
James Walsh v. Brookline Bancorp, Inc., et al.
, No. 652657/2025 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., N.Y. Cnty.), naming
as defendants Brookline and each member of the Brookline board of directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement (“Walsh”).
On April 30, 2025, an additional case was filed by a purported individual shareholder of Brookline in the same court against the
same defendants, captioned
Joseph Clark v. Brookline Bancorp, Inc., et al.
, No. 652677/2025 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., N.Y. Cnty.)
(“Clark”). The
Walsh
and
Clark
cases, and any similar subsequently filed cases involving Brookline, Berkshire,
their respective boards of directors, or any committee thereof and/or any of Brookline’s or Berkshire’s directors or officers
relating directly or indirectly to the Merger Agreement, the Merger, the Proposed Transaction, or any related transaction, are referred
to as the “Merger Litigations.” The Merger Litigations filed to date generally allege that the joint proxy statement/prospectus
omits material information and assert claims for negligent misrepresentation and concealment and negligence under New York common law.
The Merger Litigations seek, among other things, an injunction enjoining consummation of the Proposed Transaction, rescission of the Proposed
Transaction, costs of the actions, including attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees and expenses, and any other relief the court
may deem just and proper. It is possible additional demand letters may be received or additional Merger Litigations may be filed arising
out of the Proposed Transaction between May 9, 2025 and consummation of the Proposed Transaction. Brookline and Berkshire cannot
predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss from the Merger Litigations. Absent new or significantly different
allegations, Berkshire and Brookline will not necessarily disclose such additional demand letters or filings.
Berkshire and Brookline deny all allegations in the Merger Litigations
and the Demand Letters and believe that no additional disclosure is required in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. However, in order
to moot the disclosures claims, avoid nuisance, cost and distraction, and with the goal of precluding any effort to delay their respective
meetings of stockholders or the closing of the Proposed Transaction, Berkshire and Brookline hereby make additional disclosures (the “Supplemental
Disclosures”) to supplement the disclosures contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. Berkshire, the Berkshire board of
directors, Brookline, and the Brookline board of directors deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to their shareholders
in connection with the joint proxy statement/prospectus, and none of the Supplemental Disclosures nor any other disclosure in this Current
Report on Form 8-K should be construed as an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any Supplemental
Disclosures. This decision to make the Supplemental Disclosures will not affect the merger consideration to be paid in connection with
the Proposed Transaction or the timing of their respective meetings of Berkshire’s stockholders and Brookline’s stockholders.
The Supplemental Disclosures are included below and should be read in conjunction with the joint proxy statement/prospectus.
SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES TO THE JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS
The following supplemental disclosures supplement the joint proxy statement/prospectus
filed with the SEC on April 8, 2025, and first mailed to stockholders of Berkshire and Brookline as of April 15, 2025, and should
be read in connection with the joint proxy statement/prospectus, which should be read in its entirety and is available free of charge
on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Page number references below are to page numbers in the Joint proxy statement/prospectus,
and capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. To the extent the
information in the supplemental disclosures differs from or conflicts with the information contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus,
the information set forth in the supplemental disclosures shall be deemed to supersede the respective information in the joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the joint proxy statement/prospectus, and deleted text is stricken
through.
The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGERS– Background of the Mergers” is hereby supplemented by amending and restating the first full paragraph of page 68 of
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus as follows:
On May 20, 2024, the Berkshire board held
a special meeting at which the third-party investment banking firm and management presented a more detailed analysis in response to the
Berkshire board’s request for additional review and evaluation. At such meeting, the Berkshire board concluded that a transaction
combining Berkshire and Brookline in a successfully executed merger of equals had the potential to produce compelling financial upside
for the stockholders of Berkshire, and that a resulting entity combining the best aspects of both franchises with over $20 billion
in assets would be favorably positioned to compete as a strong player in key northeast markets and better serve both companies’clients and communities. The Berkshire board also determined that an appropriately structured merger of equals with Brookline would likely
be able to produce better and more sustainable long-term financial results and increased stockholder value for Berkshire stockholders
in comparison to Berkshire’s expected performance metrics and growth on a continuing stand-alone basis. The Berkshire board also
considered that the other potential strategic partners discussed were only theoretical at this stage and were unlikely to be as advantageous
of an operational and management fit as an appropriately structured merger of equals with Brookline would be.
The third-party investment
banking firm was not engaged to issue a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed merger
.
The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGERS– Background of the Mergers” is hereby supplemented by amending and restating the second full paragraph of page 70 as
follows:
On August 20, 2024, the Berkshire Special
Committee engaged RP Financial, LC. to provide an independent contribution analysis to assist the Berkshire Special Committee in evaluating
the merits of the potential merger of equals with Brookline. This contribution analysis was delivered to the Berkshire Special Committee
on August 28, 2024, and was generally consistent with the contribution analysis provided to Berkshire by Raymond James.
RP Financial,
LC. was not engaged to issue a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed merger
.
The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGERS– Background of the Mergers” is hereby supplemented by amending and restating the seventh full paragraph of page 70 as
follows:
On October 18, 2024, members of the Berkshire
Special Committee, Mr. Gray, Mr. Prescott, Mr. Perrault, Mr. Carlson, Mr. McCurdy, Mr. Meiklejohn, and representatives
from Hovde and Raymond James met to discuss the potential transaction. After the Brookline management team and their representatives from
Hovde left the meeting, the Berkshire Special Committee, as well as Mr. Gray, Mr. Prescott and representatives of Raymond James,
met with representatives from Cobblestone Management LLC (“Cobblestone”), an independent third-party loan review firm, to
discuss the results of their review and report of Brookline’s consolidated commercial and consumer loan portfolio and credit risk
management processes across all of it subsidiary banks and special lending company. After the Cobblestone report, the Berkshire Special
Committee continued meeting with Mr. Gray, Mr. Prescott and representatives of Raymond James, to further discuss the potential
merger of equals with Brookline, including financial and operational efficiencies, targeted costs saves that could be achieved and where
indicative pricing for the exchange ratio of Berkshire shares for Brookline shares might fall based on current market conditions, while
still meeting Berkshire’s desired parameters for the earnback period for the proposed transaction.
Cobblestone was not engaged
to issue a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed merger
.
The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGERS– Opinion of Brookline’s Financial Advisor - Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis” is hereby supplemented by
adding the following paragraph after the chart on page 84 of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus as follows:

The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION
OF THE MERGERS – Opinion of Berkshire’s Financial Advisor - Material Financial Analyses” and the subheading “Discounted
Cash Flow Analysis” is hereby amended by deleting and replacing the first paragraph of this subsection on page 97 of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus with the following:
Raymond
James performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Berkshire and Brookline based on the Projections. Consistent with the periods included
in the Projections, Raymond James used estimated calendar year 2029 as the final year for the analysis and applied multiples, ranging
from 11.0x to 15.0x for Berkshire and Brookline, which range was selected based on Raymond James’s professional judgement and industry
experience, to estimated calendar year 2029 adjusted earnings of $117.7 million for Berkshire and $119.5 million for Brookline, each of
which were based on the Projections. For purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, Raymond James assumed, at the direction of Berkshire,
that Berkshire had 43.2 million diluted shares outstanding and that Brookline had 90.0 million diluted shares outstanding. For both Berkshire
and Brookline, Raymond James used discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 12.6%. The discount rate ranges were chosen to reflect different
assumptions regarding required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of Berkshire or Brookline common stock and were selected
by Raymond James based on factors Raymond James considered appropriate based on its professional judgement and industry experience, which
included, among other things, risk-free rate, equity risk premium, levered beta and size premium.
Raymond James reviewed the ranges
of implied per share values indicated by the discounted cash flow analysis for each of Berkshire and Brookline and calculated a range
of implied exchange ratios by dividing the maximum implied per share value of Brookline common stock by the minimum implied per share
value of Berkshire common stock to calculate the maximum implied exchange ratio, and by dividing the minimum implied per share value of
Brookline common stock by the maximum implied per share value of Berkshire common stock to calculate the minimum implied exchange ratio.
The results of the discounted cash flow analysis are summarized in the table below:
The
disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION OF THE
MERGERS – Opinion of Berkshire’s Financial Advisor
- Material Financial Analyses” and the subheading “Pro Forma Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” is hereby amended by deleting
and replacing the first paragraph of this subsection beginning on page 98 of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the following:
Raymond
James performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate an illustrative range for the implied equity value of the pro forma combined
company, taking into account the Pro Forma Financial Adjustments. In this analysis, Raymond James used the Projections for Berkshire and
Brookline and the Pro Forma Financial Adjustments.
Consistent with the periods included in the Projections, Raymond James used
estimated calendar year 2029 as the final year for the analysis and applied multiples ranging from 10.5x to 14.5x, which range was selected
based on Raymond James’s professional judgement and industry experience, to the pro forma combined company’s estimated calendar
year 2029 adjusted earnings of $293.0 million, which was based on the Projections and the Pro Forma Financial Adjustments, to derive a
range of estimated terminal values for the combined company. For purposes of the pro forma discounted cash flow analysis, Raymond James
assumed, at the direction of Berkshire, that the pro forma combined company had 84.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Raymond James
used discount rates ranging from 10.4% to 12.4%. The discount rate range was chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding required
rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of the pro forma combined company’s common stock and was selected by Raymond James
based on factors Raymond James considered appropriate based on its professional judgement and industry experience, which included, among
other things, risk-free rate, equity risk premium, levered beta and size premium. This discounted cash flow analysis resulted in an illustrative
range of implied values per share for the pro forma combined company of $28.70 to $39.57.
The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION
OF THE MERGERS – Opinion of Berkshire’s Financial Advisor - Material Financial Analyses” and the subheading “Pro
Forma Impact Analysis” is hereby amended by deleting and replacing the fifth sentence of the first paragraph of this subsection
on page 98 of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the following:

section on page 99 of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the following:

This Current Report on Form 8-K may contain “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding the financial condition, results
of operations, business plans and the future performance of Berkshire and Brookline.
Words
such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “intends,”“plans,” “projects,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “will” or other
similar words and expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on
Berkshire’s and Brookline’s current expectations and assumptions regarding Berkshire’s and Brookline’s businesses,
the economy, and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to future results and occurrences, they are subject
to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Any number of risks, uncertainties, or other
factors could affect Berkshire’s or Brookline’s future financial results and performance and could cause actual results or
performance to differ materially from anticipated results or performance. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others: the occurrence
of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the Merger Agreement;
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Berkshire or Brookline; delays in completing the Proposed Transaction;
the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that
could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the Proposed Transaction) or stockholder approvals, or to satisfy
any of the other conditions to the Proposed Transaction on a timely basis or at all, including the ability of Berkshire and Brookline
to meet expectations regarding the timing, completion and accounting and tax treatments of the Proposed Transaction; the possibility that
the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Transaction are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of,
or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in
the areas where Berkshire and Brookline do business; the possibility that the Proposed Transaction may be more expensive to complete than
anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; the possibility that revenues following the Proposed Transaction may
be lower than expected; the impact of certain restrictions during the pendency of the Proposed Transaction on the parties’ ability
to pursue certain business opportunities and strategic transactions; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations
and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement
or completion of the Proposed Transaction; the ability to complete the Proposed Transaction and integration of Berkshire and Brookline
successfully; the dilution caused by Berkshire’s issuance of additional shares of its capital stock in connection with the Proposed
Transaction; and the potential impact of general economic, political or market factors on the companies or the Proposed Transaction and
other factors that may affect future results of Berkshire or Brookline. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Except to the
extent required by applicable law or regulation, each of Berkshire and Brookline disclaims any obligation to update such factors or to
publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On May 5, 2025, Vestis Corporation (the “Company”) appointed Jim Barber as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective as of June 2, 2025 (his first day of his employment, the “Effective Date”). Upon his assumption of the role of President and Chief Executive Officer, he will be appointed to serve on the Company’s Board of Directors.
Mr. Barber, 64, retired as the Chief Operating Officer of United Parcel Service (“UPS”) in early 2020 after a 35-year career at UPS. He served UPS as Chief Operating Officer from 2018 until January 2, 2020, President, UPS International from 2013 to 2018, and Chief Operating Officer, UPS Europe, Middle East and Africa from 2010 to 2013.
Vestis and Mr. Barber entered into an Employment Agreement, dated May 5, 2025 and effective as the Effective Date (the “Employment Agreement”), governing the terms of his service as President and Chief Executive Officer. If Mr. Barber’s employment under the Employment Agreement does not commence on the Effective Date, the Employment Agreement will  not be in force and effect.
Mr. Barber’s initial annual base salary under the Employment Agreement will be $950,000 and, beginning with the Company’s 2026 fiscal year, he will be entitled to a target annual bonus opportunity (“Target Bonus”) of 125% of his base salary, with the actual annual bonus payable to Mr. Barber for any year being determined and paid based on the terms of the Company’s Management Incentive Plan. To the extent permitted by law, the terms of the bonus plan, and to the extent approved by the Company’s Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the “Committee”), Mr. Barber’s annual bonus will be paid in shares of Company common stock.
Beginning with the Company’s 2026 fiscal year, Mr. Barber will be entitled to receive an annual equity or equity-based award under the Vestis Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”) with a target grant date value of $4,000,000, subject to approval by the Committee. The form, timing and terms of any such awards will be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee and will be made at the same time as annual awards are made to similarly-situated executives of the Company; provided further that, for purposes of determining the vesting of such awards, “Retirement” for Mr. Barber will be defined as the attainment of age 65 and the completion of at least 4 years of service with the Company. In connection with his commencement of employment, Mr. Barber will also be entitled to receive an initial grant of restricted stock units (the “Sign-On Award”) under the LTIP with a value of $3,000,000. The number of restricted stock units subject to the Sign-On Award will be based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on the second business day following the Company’s May, 2025 earnings release and the Sign-On Award will be granted as soon as practicable following the Effective Date with vesting to occur on the third anniversary of the Effective Date subject to Executive’s continued employment through such third anniversary (other than as a result of death).
Mr. Barber is also generally eligible to participate in the Company’s standard employee benefit plans maintained from time to time for similarly situated executives; Mr. Barber, however, will not be entitled to participate in any termination or severance pay plan of the Company.
Under the Employment Agreement, upon Mr. Barber’s termination of employment with the Company and its affiliates for any reason (the Termination Date”), he will be entitled to any accrued amounts (such as accrued but unpaid salary and vacation and benefits required by an applicable employee benefit plan or applicable law). Upon termination, Mr. Barber’s outstanding equity and equity-based awards will be treated in the manner provided in the LTIP and the applicable award agreements; provided, however, that in the case of an Anticipatory Change in Control (as described below), the equity awards will remain outstanding until the earliest of (a) 6 months after the Termination Date, (b) the date of a Change of Control (as defined in the LTIP), and (c) the expiration date of the award.
If Mr. Barber’s Termination Date occurs by reason of death, disability, termination by the Company for Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or termination by Mr. Barber without Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), Mr. Barber will be entitled only to the accrued amounts.
If Mr. Barber’s Termination Date occurs prior to the fourth anniversary of the Effective Date on account of termination by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Barber for Good Reason (and other than as a result of a Qualifying Termination as described below), he will be entitled to the following payments and benefits (in addition to the accrued amounts), subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release:•a payment equal to the sum of 18 months of his base salary plus target bonus payable in accordance with the normal payroll practices of the Company ratably over 18 months;•a pro-rata portion of the annual bonus that would otherwise have been paid to him for the year of termination had the Termination Date not occurred, taking into account satisfaction of any applicable performance conditions, payable in a lump sum at the same time as annual bonuses for the year to which the pro-rata bonus relates are payable to similarly-situated executives of the Company whose Termination Date has not occurred; and•if he is eligible for and timely elects COBRA coverage, a monthly payment (each a “Benefit Payment”) equal to the amount of the applicable monthly premium for the COBRA coverage, which Benefit Payments will be payable for the lesser of 18 months following the Termination Date or the date on which the COBRA coverage terminates by its terms (the “COBRA Period”).
If Mr. Barber’s Termination Date occurs prior to the fourth anniversary of the Effective Date as the result of a “Qualifying Termination,” meaning termination of Mr. Barber’s employment (a) within 2 years after a Change of Control by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Barber for Good Reason or (b) within 6 months prior to a Change of Control at the request of a third party involved in a Change of Control or otherwise in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control (which termination is referred to as an “Anticipatory Change of Control Termination”), he will be entitled to the following payments and benefits, subject, in any case, to Mr. Barber’s execution and non-revocation of a release:•a lump sum payment equal to 2 times the sum of his base salary and target bonus;•a lump sum payment equal to a pro-rata portion of his Target Bonus for the year in which the termination occurs; and•if he is eligible for and elects COBRA coverage, the Benefit Payments continue for the COBRA Period.
Mr. Barber is not entitled to duplicate benefits for both a termination prior to a Change of Control and a Qualifying Termination.
The Employment Agreement requires Mr. Barber to enter into a restricted covenant agreement that provides for perpetual non-disclosure and non-disparagement covenants and 18 months post-employment non-competition, non-solicitation and non-hire covenants.
A copy of the Employment Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K and attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing description of the Employment Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Employment Agreement.

Other Events
As previously disclosed on December 16, 2024, Brookline Bancorp, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (“Brookline”), Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Berkshire”),
and Commerce Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire (“Merger Sub”),
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Brookline, with Brookline as the surviving entity
(the “Merger”), and immediately following the Merger, Brookline will merge with and into Berkshire, with Berkshire as the
surviving entity (the “Holdco Merger”). The Merger Agreement further provides that immediately following the Merger, Berkshire
Bank, a Massachusetts trust company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire, Bank Rhode Island, a Rhode Island-chartered bank and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Brookline, and PCSB Bank, a New York savings bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookline, each will merge
with and into Brookline Bank, a Massachusetts trust company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookline, with Brookline Bank as the surviving
bank (the “Bank Mergers” and, together with the Merger and the Holdco Merger, the “Proposed Transaction”).
In connection with the Proposed Transaction, Berkshire filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 24, 2025 a registration statement on Form S-4 containing
a joint proxy statement/prospectus, as amended, and Brookline filed a definitive proxy statement and Berkshire filed a definitive proxy
statement/prospectus with the SEC, dated April 8, 2025 (collectively, the “joint proxy statement/prospectus”), with respect
to the annual meeting of the Berkshire stockholders and the special meeting of the Brookline stockholders scheduled to be held on May 21,
2025, respectively. Berkshire and Brookline first mailed the joint proxy statement/prospectus to their respective stockholders on or about
April 15, 2025.
In connection with the Proposed Transaction, from April 12, 2025
to May 8, 2025, Berkshire received four demand letters and Brookline received nine demand letters from purported Berkshire and Brookline
stockholders, respectively (“Demand Letters”), alleging that the joint proxy statement/prospectus omits material information
in violation of federal securities laws and state law disclosure requirements and demanding that Berkshire and Brookline provide additional
disclosures in an amendment or supplement to the joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, on April 29, 2025, a purported individual
shareholder of Brookline filed a complaint in New York state court, captioned
James Walsh v. Brookline Bancorp, Inc., et al.
,
No. 652657/2025 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., N.Y. Cnty.), naming as defendants Brookline and each member of the Brookline board of directors as
of the date of the Merger Agreement (“Walsh”). On April 30, 2025, an additional case was filed by a purported
individual shareholder of Brookline in the same court against the same defendants, captioned
Joseph Clark v. Brookline Bancorp, Inc.,
et al.
, No. 652677/2025 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., N.Y. Cnty.) (“Clark”). The
Walsh
and
Clark
cases, and
any similar subsequently filed cases involving Brookline, Berkshire, their respective boards of directors, or any committee thereof and/or
any of Brookline’s or Berkshire’s directors or officers relating directly or indirectly to the Merger Agreement, the Merger,
the Proposed Transaction, or any related transaction, are referred to as the “Merger Litigations.” The Merger Litigations
filed to date generally allege that the joint proxy statement/prospectus omits material information and assert claims for negligent misrepresentation
and concealment and negligence under New York common law. The Merger Litigations seek, among other things, an injunction enjoining consummation
of the Proposed Transaction, rescission of the Proposed Transaction, costs of the actions, including attorneys’ fees and experts’fees and expenses, and any other relief the court may deem just and proper. It is possible additional demand letters may be received or
additional Merger Litigations may be filed arising out of the Proposed Transaction between May 9, 2025 and consummation of the Proposed
Transaction. Brookline and Berkshire cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss from the Merger Litigations.
Absent new or significantly different allegations, Berkshire and Brookline will not necessarily disclose such additional demand letters
or filings.
Berkshire and Brookline deny all allegations in the Merger Litigations
and the Demand Letters and believe that no additional disclosure is required in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. However, in order
to moot the disclosures claims, avoid nuisance, cost and distraction, and with the goal of precluding any effort to delay their respective
meetings of stockholders or the closing of the Proposed Transaction, Berkshire and Brookline hereby make additional disclosures (the “Supplemental
Disclosures”) to supplement the disclosures contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. Berkshire, the Berkshire board of
directors, Brookline, and the Brookline board of directors deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to their shareholders
in connection with the joint proxy statement/prospectus, and none of the Supplemental Disclosures nor any other disclosure in this Current
Report on Form 8-K should be construed as an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any Supplemental
Disclosures. This decision to make the Supplemental Disclosures will not affect the merger consideration to be paid in connection with
the Proposed Transaction or the timing of their respective meetings of Berkshire’s stockholders and Brookline’s stockholders.
The Supplemental Disclosures are included below and should be read in conjunction with the joint proxy statement/prospectus.
SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES TO THE JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS
The following supplemental disclosures supplement the joint proxy statement/prospectus
filed with the SEC on April 8, 2025, and first mailed to stockholders of Berkshire and Brookline as of April 15, 2025, and should
be read in connection with the joint proxy statement/prospectus, which should be read in its entirety and is available free of charge
on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Page number references below are to page numbers in the Joint proxy statement/prospectus,
and capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. To the extent the
information in the supplemental disclosures differs from or conflicts with the information contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus,
the information set forth in the supplemental disclosures shall be deemed to supersede the respective information in the joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the joint proxy statement/prospectus, and deleted text is stricken
through.
The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGERS– Background of the Mergers” is hereby supplemented by amending and restating the first full paragraph of page 68 of
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus as follows:
On May 20, 2024, the Berkshire board held
a special meeting at which the third-party investment banking firm and management presented a more detailed analysis in response to the
Berkshire board’s request for additional review and evaluation. At such meeting, the Berkshire board concluded that a transaction
combining Berkshire and Brookline in a successfully executed merger of equals had the potential to produce compelling financial upside
for the stockholders of Berkshire, and that a resulting entity combining the best aspects of both franchises with over $20 billion
in assets would be favorably positioned to compete as a strong player in key northeast markets and better serve both companies’clients and communities. The Berkshire board also determined that an appropriately structured merger of equals with Brookline would likely
be able to produce better and more sustainable long-term financial results and increased stockholder value for Berkshire stockholders
in comparison to Berkshire’s expected performance metrics and growth on a continuing stand-alone basis. The Berkshire board also
considered that the other potential strategic partners discussed were only theoretical at this stage and were unlikely to be as advantageous
of an operational and management fit as an appropriately structured merger of equals with Brookline would be.
The third-party investment
banking firm was not engaged to issue a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed merger
.
The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGERS– Background of the Mergers” is hereby supplemented by amending and restating the second full paragraph of page 70 as
follows:
On August 20, 2024, the Berkshire Special
Committee engaged RP Financial, LC. to provide an independent contribution analysis to assist the Berkshire Special Committee in evaluating
the merits of the potential merger of equals with Brookline. This contribution analysis was delivered to the Berkshire Special Committee
on August 28, 2024, and was generally consistent with the contribution analysis provided to Berkshire by Raymond James.
RP Financial,

The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION
OF THE MERGERS – Opinion of Berkshire’s Financial Advisor - Material Financial Analyses” and the subheading “Discounted
Cash Flow Analysis” is hereby amended by deleting and replacing the first paragraph of this subsection on page 97 of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus with the following:
Raymond
James performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Berkshire and Brookline based on the Projections. Consistent with the periods included
in the Projections, Raymond James used estimated calendar year 2029 as the final year for the analysis and applied multiples, ranging
from 11.0x to 15.0x for Berkshire and Brookline, which range was selected based on Raymond James’s professional judgement and industry
experience, to estimated calendar year 2029 adjusted earnings of $117.7 million for Berkshire and $119.5 million for Brookline, each of
which were based on the Projections. For purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, Raymond James assumed, at the direction of Berkshire,
that Berkshire had 43.2 million diluted shares outstanding and that Brookline had 90.0 million diluted shares outstanding. For both Berkshire
and Brookline, Raymond James used discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 12.6%. The discount rate ranges were chosen to reflect different
assumptions regarding required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of Berkshire or Brookline common stock and were selected
by Raymond James based on factors Raymond James considered appropriate based on its professional judgement and industry experience, which
included, among other things, risk-free rate, equity risk premium, levered beta and size premium.
Raymond James reviewed the ranges
of implied per share values indicated by the discounted cash flow analysis for each of Berkshire and Brookline and calculated a range
of implied exchange ratios by dividing the maximum implied per share value of Brookline common stock by the minimum implied per share
value of Berkshire common stock to calculate the maximum implied exchange ratio, and by dividing the minimum implied per share value of
Brookline common stock by the maximum implied per share value of Berkshire common stock to calculate the minimum implied exchange ratio.
The results of the discounted cash flow analysis are summarized in the table below:
The
disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION OF THE
MERGERS – Opinion of Berkshire’s Financial Advisor
- Material Financial Analyses” and the subheading “Pro Forma Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” is hereby amended by deleting
and replacing the first paragraph of this subsection beginning on page 98 of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the following:
Raymond
James performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate an illustrative range for the implied equity value of the pro forma combined
company, taking into account the Pro Forma Financial Adjustments. In this analysis, Raymond James used the Projections for Berkshire and
Brookline and the Pro Forma Financial Adjustments.
Consistent with the periods included in the Projections, Raymond James used
estimated calendar year 2029 as the final year for the analysis and applied multiples ranging from 10.5x to 14.5x, which range was selected
based on Raymond James’s professional judgement and industry experience, to the pro forma combined company’s estimated calendar
year 2029 adjusted earnings of $293.0 million, which was based on the Projections and the Pro Forma Financial Adjustments, to derive a
range of estimated terminal values for the combined company. For purposes of the pro forma discounted cash flow analysis, Raymond James
assumed, at the direction of Berkshire, that the pro forma combined company had 84.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Raymond James
used discount rates ranging from 10.4% to 12.4%. The discount rate range was chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding required
rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of the pro forma combined company’s common stock and was selected by Raymond James
based on factors Raymond James considered appropriate based on its professional judgement and industry experience, which included, among
other things, risk-free rate, equity risk premium, levered beta and size premium. This discounted cash flow analysis resulted in an illustrative
range of implied values per share for the pro forma combined company of $28.70 to $39.57.
The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION
OF THE MERGERS – Opinion of Berkshire’s Financial Advisor - Material Financial Analyses” and the subheading “Pro

On May 9, 2025, Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing 24-week post-end of treatment data from Part B of its ongoing MARCH Phase 2 clinical study evaluating tobevibart, an investigational broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting the hepatitis B surface antigen, and elebsiran, an investigational hepatitis B virus-targeting small interfering ribonucleic acid, with or without pegylated interferon alpha, for the treatment of participants living with chronic hepatitis B.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 9, 2025 (the “Issue Date”), Xerox Corporation completed its previously announced private offering of $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 13.500% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2031 (the “Additional Notes”) issued by Xerox Issuer Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Corporation (“Escrow Issuer”).
The Additional Notes have been issued as additional notes under the Indenture dated as of April 11, 2025 (the “Base Indenture”) entered into between the Escrow Issuer and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent, as supplemented by that certain first supplemental indenture, dated as of May 9, 2025 (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), governing the Escrow Issuer’s $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 13.500% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2031, issued on April 11, 2025 (the “Original Notes” and, together with the Additional Notes, the “Notes”). The Additional Notes will be consolidated with and form a single series under the Indenture and will be treated as a single class together with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Except with respect to the Additional Notes offered in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which will initially be issued bearing a temporary CUSIP and a temporary ISIN, the Additional Notes are expected to have the same CUSIPs and ISINs as, and are expected to be fungible with, the Original Notes immediately upon issuance.
Xerox Corporation intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Additional Notes to (i) fund a portion of the purchase price for the proposed acquisition (the “Lexmark Acquisition”) of all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Lexmark International II, LLC (“Lexmark”), as previously announced on December 22, 2024 and the repayment of substantially all of Lexmark’s outstanding debt (together with accrued interest and any applicable expenses, fees or premiums) and (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the offering, the Lexmark Acquisition and the related transactions.
The Notes, including the Additional Notes, bear interest at a rate of 13.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, beginning on October 15, 2025. Pending consummation of the Lexmark Acquisition, concurrently with the issuance of the Additional Notes, the gross proceeds of the Additional Notes will be deposited into an escrow account for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. In addition, on the Issue Date, Escrow Issuer deposited or caused to be deposited an amount equal to the difference between (x) $98,000,000 and (y) the gross proceeds of the Additional Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest, from and including, April 11, 2025 to, but excluding, the Issue Date into the escrow account. The release of such proceeds from the escrow account will occur on such date that certain escrow release conditions, including the consummation of the Lexmark Acquisition, have been satisfied. The escrow account is pledged on a first priority basis in favor of the trustee for the Notes for the benefit of holders of the Notes. If the Lexmark Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to December 22, 2025 (subject to extension) or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 98% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from, and including, the most recent interest payment date, or April 11, 2025, if no interest has been paid, to, but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date.
Upon the consummation of the Lexmark Acquisition, subject to certain escrow release conditions, the escrowed proceeds will be released (the “Escrow Release”) from the escrow account and the Escrow Issuer will be merged with and into Xerox Corporation. Upon the Escrow Release, Xerox Corporation, Xerox Holdings Corporation (“Xerox”) and certain of Xerox’s domestic and foreign subsidiaries that guarantee the Xerox Corporation’s 10.250% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2030 will enter into one or more supplemental indentures to the Indenture to provide for the assumption by Xerox Corporation of the obligations of the Escrow Issuer as issuer of the Notes and for the guarantees of the Notes by Xerox and such subsidiaries (the “Assumption”). On the date of Escrow Release and upon consummation of the Assumption, the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, will be secured on a second-priority basis by security interests in substantially all of the assets of Xerox and such subsidiaries (the “Xerox Collateral”) that is Fixed Asset Collateral (as defined in the Indenture) and on a third-priority basis by the Xerox Collateral that is Current Asset Collateral (as defined in the Indenture).
Within 90 business days following the completion of the Lexmark Acquisition, subject to certain agreed security principles, the Notes will be jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Lexmark and certain of Lexmark’s subsidiaries that will become guarantors under Xerox Corporation’s first lien senior secured term loan credit facility (the“TLB Facility”). Subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, the Notes will be further secured by security interests in substantially all of the assets of Lexmark and certain of Lexmark’s subsidiaries that will secure the TLB Facility (the “Lexmark Collateral”) on a second-priority basis by the Lexmark Collateral that is Fixed Asset Collateral and on a third-priority basis by the Lexmark Collateral that is Current Asset Collateral.
At any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2028, some or all of the Notes are redeemable for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium described in the Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. Beginning on April 15, 2028, some or all of the Notes are redeemable at any time and from time to time at the applicable redemption prices listed in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2028, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes are redeemable with funds from one or more equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 113.500% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In addition, prior to April 15, 2028, during each
12-month
period commencing with the issue date of the Notes, up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Following the date of the Escrow Release, if Xerox Corporation experiences a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture), Xerox Corporation will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes, at 101% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.
The Indenture contains covenants that, following the date of the Escrow Release, among other things, limit the ability of Xerox, Xerox Corporation and Xerox Corporation’s restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, prepay, redeem or repurchase certain subordinated debt, issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities, make loans and investments, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, incur liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all assets.
The Indenture provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of other agreements in respect of the Notes, failure to pay certain other indebtedness, failure to pay certain final judgments, failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.
The foregoing summary and description of the Indenture and the Notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Indenture, which is filed as Exhibits 4.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 8, 2025, Opendoor Technologies Inc. (the “Company”) entered into privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreements (the “Exchange and Subscription
Agreements”) with certain holders of the Company’s 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and new investors, pursuant to which the Company will issue $325.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.000% Convertible Senior
Notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) consisting of (a) approximately $245.8 million principal amount of 2030 Notes issued in exchange for approximately $245.8 million principal amount of 2026 Notes (the “Exchange Transactions”), and (b) approximately
$79.2 million principal amount of 2030 Notes for cash (the “Subscription Transactions” and, together with the Exchange Transactions, the “Transactions”), in each case, pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”), and the rules and regulations thereunder.
The 2030 Notes will be issued under an indenture (the “New Notes Indenture”), expected to be dated on or around May 16, 2025, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust
Company, National Association.
The 2030 Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and will accrue interest at a rate of 7.000% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and
November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2025. The 2030 Notes will mature on May 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before November 15, 2029, noteholders will have the right to convert their 2030 Notes only upon
the occurrence of certain events. From and including November 15, 2029, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The
Company will settle conversions by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be converted and paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock,
at its election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes being converted based on the applicable conversion rate(s). The initial conversion rate is 637.1050
shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2030 Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $1.57 per share of common stock. Based on the initial conversion rate 207,059,125 shares of common stock would be issued
upon conversion of the 2030 Notes. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 80% over the last reported sale price of $0.872 per share of the Company’s common stock on May 8, 2025. The conversion rate and conversion price
will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.
The 2030 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after
May 22, 2028 and before the 36th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time and
certain liquidity conditions have been satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant redemption date.
Holders of the 2030 Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or part of their 2030 Notes for cash on May 15, 2028 or, subject to certain
conditions, in the event of certain fundamental changes (as defined in the New Notes Indenture), at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the relevant repurchase date.
In connection with the Transactions, the Company has been advised that J. Wood Capital Advisors LLC (“JWCA”), the Company’s financial advisor with respect to the
Transactions, intends to purchase approximately 16.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock concurrently with the Transactions in privately negotiated transactions from certain exchanging holders
and/or purchasers of the 2030 Notes through a financial intermediary at a discount to the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on May 8, 2025. JWCA has also agreed not to sell such shares of common stock for 30 days. Such
concurrent purchases by JWCA of the Company’s common stock could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock, the 2026 Notes or the 2030 Notes. JWCA also intends to
purchase $5.0 million principal amount of the 2030 Notes for cash in the Subscription
Transactions.
Following the closing of the Exchange Transactions, approximately $135.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes will remain outstanding with terms unchanged.
The Company expects that the gross proceeds from the Subscription Transactions will be approximately $75.3 million, excluding offering fees and transaction expenses, and intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company
will not receive any cash proceeds from the Exchange Transactions. The Transactions are expected to close concurrently on or about May 16, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.
A copy of the Form of Exchange and Subscription Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein. The
foregoing description of the Form of Exchange and Subscription Agreement does not purport to
be complete and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.
This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, nor is it a solicitation of an offer to buy, the 2030 Notes or the Company’s common stock, nor shall
there be any sale of the 2030 Notes or the Company’s common stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any state or any
jurisdiction.
Item 3.02
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. The offer and sale of the 2030 Notes and the common
stock of the Company issuable upon conversion, if any, have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable
exemption from such registration requirements. The 2030 Notes were offered in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The issuance of common stock upon conversion, if any, is expected to be exempt from registration
pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act as involving an exchange by the Company exclusively with its security holders.

indebtedness; the current and future health and stability of the economy, financial conditions and residential housing market, including any extended downturns or slowdowns; changes in general economic and financial conditions (including federal
monetary policy, the imposition of tariffs and price or exchange controls, interest rates, inflation, actual or anticipated recession, home price fluctuations, and housing inventory), as well as the probability of such changes occurring, that may
impact demand for the Company’s products and services, lower the Company’s profitability or reduce its access to future financings; actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company’s financial condition and results of operations; changes in
projected operational and financial results; and the Company’s real estate assets and increased competition in the U.S. residential real estate industry; the Company’s ability to operate and grow its core business products, including the ability to
obtain sufficient financing and resell purchased homes. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described under the caption “Risk Factors” in the
Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 27, 2025, as updated by its periodic reports and other filings with the SEC. These filings identify and address other
important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On May 6, 2025, Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (the “Company”) held its 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”). At the Annual Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment (the “Amendment”) to Section 5.2 of Article V of the Company’s amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), to declassify the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and phase-in annual director elections such that, beginning with the Company’s 2028 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each director will be elected annually. Pursuant to the Amendment, the declassification of the Board will be phased-in over a three-year period as follows:
1.
Class III directors will be elected at the 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders for a term of one year expiring at the 2027 Annual Meeting of Stockholders;
2.
Class I and III directors will be elected at the 2027 Annual Meeting of Stockholders for a term of one year expiring at the 2028 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; and
3.
Class I, II and III directors will be elected at the 2028 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to serve for a term of one year expiring at the 2029 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Consistent with Delaware law, the Amendment provides that any director may be removed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon (i) until the election of directors at the 2028 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, only for cause, and (ii) from and after the election of directors at the 2028 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, with or without cause. The Amendment also provides that while the declassification of the Board is being phased-in (i.e., until the 2028 Annual Meeting of Stockholders), the number of directors in each class shall be apportioned in the manner determined by the Board and that any director elected to a newly created Board seat or to fill a vacancy will serve for the same term as the remainder of the class to which the director is elected.
The Amendment became effective upon the filing of a Certificate of Amendment of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 8, 2025.
The foregoing description of the Amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
As of the close of business on March 12, 2025, the record date for the Annual Meeting, 34,663,598 shares of common stock of the Company were outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  At the Annual Meeting, 31,054,014.84 shares of common stock, or approximately 89.59% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, were represented in person or by proxy and, therefore, a quorum was present.
The stockholders of the Company voted on the following items at the Annual Meeting:
1.
The election of three Class II directors to hold office until the 2028 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
2.
The ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
2033 Notes Indenture
On May 9, 2025, CHS/Community Health Systems, Inc. (the “Issuer”), a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Community Health Systems, Inc. (the “Company”), completed its previously announced sale and issuance of $700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 10.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2033 (the “2033 Notes”). The terms of the 2033 Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of May 9, 2025, among the Issuer, the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”) (the “2033 Notes Indenture”).
The 2033 Notes bear interest at a rate of 10.750% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2025.
The 2033 Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior-priority secured basis by the Company and each of the Issuer’s current and future domestic subsidiaries that provide guarantees under the Issuer’s ABL facility (the “ABL Facility”), any capital market debt securities of the Issuer (including the Issuer’s outstanding senior notes) and certain other long-term debt of the Issuer and the guarantors.
The 2033 Notes and the guarantees are secured by (i) first-priority liens on the collateral (the “Non-ABL Priority Collateral”) that also secures on a first-priority basis the Issuer’s existing senior-priority secured notes (the “Existing Senior-Priority Secured Notes”) and (ii) second-priority liens on the collateral (the “ABL-Priority Collateral” and, together with the Non-ABL Priority Collateral, the “Collateral”) that secures on a first-priority basis the ABL Facility (and also secures on a second-priority basis the Existing Senior-Priority Secured Notes), in each case subject to permitted liens described in the 2033 Notes Indenture. The 2033 Notes are subject to the terms of three intercreditor agreements: (1) the intercreditor agreement which governs the relative rights of the secured parties in respect of the ABL Facility, the Existing Senior-Priority Secured Notes, the Issuer’s existing junior-priority secured notes (the “Existing Junior-Priority Secured Notes”) and the 2033 Notes (the “ABL Intercreditor Agreement”), (2) the intercreditor agreement which governs the relative rights of the secured parties in respect of the Existing Senior-Priority Secured Notes, the Existing Junior-Priority Secured Notes and the 2033 Notes (the “Senior-Junior Intercreditor Agreement”) and (3) the intercreditor agreement which governs the relative rights of holders of the 2033 Notes, holders of the Existing Senior-Priority Secured Notes and holders of any future obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the 2033 Notes (the “Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement” and, together with the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior-Junior Intercreditor Agreement, the “Intercreditor Agreements”). Each of the Intercreditor Agreements restricts the actions permitted to be taken by the Collateral Agent with respect to the Collateral on behalf of the holders of the 2033 Notes.
At any time prior to June 15, 2030, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the 2033 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2033 Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in the 2033 Notes Indenture. On or after June 15, 2030, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the 2033 Notes at any time and from time to time at the redemption prices set forth in the 2033 Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2030, the Issuer may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2033 Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the 2033 Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date.
If the Company or the Issuer experiences a Change of Control (as defined in the 2033 Notes Indenture), the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase the 2033 Notes at 101% of the principal amount of the 2033 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.
The 2033 Notes Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Issuer’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, incur restrictions on the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors to pay dividends or make certain other payments, create or incur certain liens, sell assets and subsidiary stock, impair the security interests, transfer all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The 2033 Notes Indenture provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of other agreements in the 2033 Notes Indenture, failure to pay certain other indebtedness, failure to pay certain final judgments, failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable, failure to perfect certain collateral securing the 2033 Notes issued pursuant to the 2033 Notes Indenture and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.
The foregoing summary and description of the 2033 Notes Indenture and the 2033 Notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the 2033 Notes Indenture, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

As previously disclosed by the Company, on April 23, 2025, the Issuer commenced a solicitation of consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) from holders of the Issuer’s outstanding 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) to adopt certain proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments”) to the indenture governing the 2028 Notes (the “2028 Notes Indenture”) that, if adopted, would among other things, eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants, certain events of default and certain other provisions contained in the 2028 Notes Indenture. The Consent Solicitation is being made by the Issuer in connection with the Issuer’s offer to purchase for cash any and all of the Issuer’s outstanding 2028 Notes (the “Tender Offer”). Each holder who validly tenders (or tendered) 2028 Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer is (or was) deemed to have validly delivered its related consent to the Proposed Amendments.
Also, as previously disclosed, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 6, 2025, the Issuer received the requisite number of consents to adopt the Proposed Amendments, and as of such date and time, revocation rights for consents delivered in the Consent Solicitation expired and delivered consents ceased to be revocable, except as required by law.
On May 8, 2025, the Issuer, the guarantors and the trustee of the 2028 Notes entered into a supplemental indenture containing the Proposed Amendments (the “Supplemental Indenture”) to the 2028 Notes Indenture. As a result of the Supplemental Indenture, among other things, the following provisions have been removed from the 2028 Notes Indenture: (i) the limitation on indebtedness covenant, (ii) the limitation on restricted payments covenant, (iii) the limitation on restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries covenant, (iv) the limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock covenant, (v) the limitation on liens covenant, (vi) the limitation on guarantees covenant, (vii) the limitation on affiliate transactions covenant, (viii) the provision requiring an offer to repurchase notes upon a change of control, (ix) the reporting covenant, (x) the maintenance of office or agency covenant, (xi) the corporate existence covenant, (xii) the payment of taxes covenant, (xiii) the provision requiring delivery of a compliance certificate, (xiv) the provision requiring a statement by officers as to default, (xv) the provision on designation of restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries, (xvi) certain provisions imposing limitations on mergers and consolidations and (xvii) certain events of default.
The Supplemental Indenture became effective upon execution on May 8, 2025, and the Proposed Amendments will be binding on all holders of 2028 Notes who did not validly tender their 2028 Notes in the Tender Offer.
The foregoing summary and description of the Supplemental Indenture does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Supplemental Indenture, which is filed as Exhibit 4.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
The Tender Offer is being made solely by means of the Issuer’s Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated April 23, 2025. Under no circumstances shall this Current Report on Form 8-K constitute an offer to purchase or sell or the solicitation of an offer to purchase or sell the 2028 Notes or any other securities of the Issuer or any other person, nor shall there be any offer or sale of any 2028 Notes or other securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. In addition, nothing contained herein constitutes a notice of redemption of the 2028 Notes. No recommendation is made as to whether holders of 2028 Notes should tender their 2028 Notes.

On May 5, 2025, Postal Realty Trust, Inc.

An additional property for which REAC provides management services to affiliates of Mr. Spodek was not amended by the Amended Management Agreements.
The Amended Management Agreements provide that, as of April 1, 2025, the initial management fee to be received by REAC is equal to 4.0% per annum of each property’s gross revenue, payable quarterly.  Each successive April 1, the management fee will be increased to 102.5% of the management fee previously in effect. The initial term of the Amended Management Agreements is through March 31, 2030 (the “Initial Term”), unless terminated earlier. After the Initial Term, the Amended Management Agreements will be automatically renewed for successive one-year terms, unless either party provides 30 days' advance notice of non-renewal. Furthermore, beginning October 1, 2025, the Amended Management Agreements may be terminated by either party at any time upon 60 days’ notice to the other party. The Amended Management Agreements also provide that, to the extent REAC provides services in connection with the financing of managed properties, REAC shall be entitled to an additional $5,000 fee per property being financed, whether such properties are financed individually, as part of a portfolio or pooled, provided that the total fees payable shall not exceed $50,000 per financing transaction.

Establishment of “At the Market”Offering Program
On May 9, 2025, Nuvectis Pharma, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”), entered into a Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Leerink Partners LLC
(“Leerink Partners”) as sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock, $0.00001
par value per share (the “Common Stock”), from time to time through Leerink Partners. The Company has filed a prospectus supplement
(the “Prospectus Supplement”), dated as of May 9, 2025, relating to the Sales Agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) under the Company’s existing shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-270657), which was declared
effective by the SEC on March 29, 2023 (the “Registration Statement”). Pursuant to the Prospectus Supplement and accompanying
base prospectus, which form a part of the Registration Statement, the Company may offer and sell shares of Common Stock for an amount
up to $60 million under the Sales Agreement (the “ATM Shares”).
Sales of the ATM Shares, if any, will be made
in sales deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the “Securities Act”). Leerink Partners is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of securities
but will act as sales agent using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable
law and regulations on mutually agreed terms between Leerink Partners and the Company. There is no arrangement for funds to be received
in any escrow, trust or similar arrangement.
The compensation to Leerink Partners for the ATM Shares sold pursuant
to the Sales Agreement will be an amount equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the ATM Shares sold under the Sales Agreement. The proceeds
the Company receives from sales of the ATM Shares, if any, will depend on the number of ATM Shares actually sold and the offering price
of such ATM Shares. The Company has agreed to pay to Leerink Partners certain costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations
under the Sales Agreement. The Company has also agreed to provide indemnification and reimbursement to Leerink Partners with respect to
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The Sales Agreement contains customary representations,
warranties, and agreements by the Company and customary indemnification rights and obligations of the parties.
This Current Report on Form 8-K shall not constitute
an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy the ATM Shares, nor shall there be any sale of the ATM Shares in any state in which
such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of such state or jurisdiction.
A copy of the Sales Agreement is attached as Exhibit
10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the material terms of the Sales Agreement is not complete
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.

has issued a legal opinion relating to the ATM Shares. A copy of such legal opinion, including the consent included therein, is attached

As described in Item 5.07 below, Lightbridge Corporation (the “Company”) held its 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) on May 8, 2025. At the Annual Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Lightbridge Corporation 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended, the “2020 Plan”). The amendment to the 2020 Plan became effective upon stockholder approval and increased the number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), that may be issued thereunder from 2,500,000 shares to 5,000,000 shares, as described under Proposal 3 of the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed on Schedule 14A with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2025 (the “2025 Proxy Statement”), which description is incorporated herein by reference.
The foregoing description of the 2020 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the 2020 Plan, which is set forth in Appendix B to the Company’s 2025 Proxy Statement.

Certificate of Withdrawal
After the Annual Meeting, the Company redeemed the one outstanding share of the Company’s Series X Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 (the “Series X Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate of $100 paid to the sole holder of the Series X Preferred Stock.  Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation for the Series X Preferred Stock, upon such redemption, the one previously outstanding share of Series X Preferred Stock was automatically retired and restored to the status of an authorized but unissued share of the Company’s authorized and undesignated preferred stock. On May 8, 2025, the Company filed a Certificate of Withdrawal with the Nevada Secretary of State, which became effective upon filing. The Certificate of Withdrawal withdrew and terminated the effectiveness of the Certificate of Designation for the Series X Preferred Stock, eliminating the previous designation of the Series X Preferred Stock, none of which was outstanding at the time of the filing of the Certificate of Withdrawal.
A copy of the Certificate of Withdrawal is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information
Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K may be considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including, but not limited to, CuriosityStream’s expectations or predictions of future financial or business performance or conditions, plans to pay regular dividends, consumers’ valuation of factual content, and the Company’s continued success. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “anticipates,” “predicts” or “intends” or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such
statements. Certain of these risks are identified and discussed under “Risk Factors” in CuriosityStream’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, that the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 25, 2025, and in CuriosityStream’s other SEC filings. These risk factors are important to consider in determining future results and should be reviewed in their entirety. Forward-looking statements are based on the current belief of the management of CuriosityStream, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events, and involve factors, risks, and uncertainties that may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from such statements. However, there can be no assurance that the events, results or trends identified in these forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and CuriosityStream is not under any obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Readers should carefully review the statements set forth in the reports that CuriosityStream has filed or will file from time to time with the SEC.
In addition to factors previously disclosed in CuriosityStream’s reports filed with the SEC and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: (i) risks related to CuriosityStream’s ability to maintain and develop new and existing revenue-generating relationships and partnerships or to significantly increase CuriosityStream’s subscriber base and retain customers; (ii) the effects of pending and future legislation; (iii) risks of the internet, online commerce and media industry; (iv) the highly competitive nature of the internet, online commerce and media industry and CuriosityStream’s ability to compete therein; (v) litigation, complaints, and/or adverse publicity; and (vi) privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or the loss of data.

On
May 9, 2025, First Community Corporation (the “Company”), the holding company for First Community Bank, announced that its
Board of Directors approved a plan to utilize up to $7.5 million of capital to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock,
which represents approximately 5.0% of total shareholders’ equity as of March 31, 2025.
Under
the repurchase plan, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time, through May 8, 2026, by means of, among other means, open market
purchases and in solicited and unsolicited privately negotiated transactions.
The actual means and timing of any purchases,
quantity
of purchased shares
and prices will be,
subject to certain limitations, at the discretion
of management during such period, and will
depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company’s common
stock, share issuances under Company equity plans, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
The
Company’s management believes the repurchase plan, depending upon market and business conditions, may, among other things, provide
capital management opportunities for the Company.
The Company is not obligated to repurchase any such shares under the repurchase
plan.
Through May 8, 2026, the repurchase plan may be discontinued, suspended or restarted at any
time."

On April 25, 2025, NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust (the “Company”) filed a definitive proxy statement/prospectus (the “Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with its annual meeting of shareholders to be held on Tuesday, June 10, 2025, beginning at 10:30 a.m. Central Time (the “Annual Meeting”), to consider, among other things, the conversion of the Company’s jurisdiction and form of organization from a Delaware statutory trust to a Maryland corporation and the approval of the Amended and Restated NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust 2023 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “A&R 2023 Plan”). This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed to correct typographical errors contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus as noted below.
If you have already voted by internet, telephone or mail or provided voting instructions, you do not need to take any action unless you wish to change your vote. Any shareholder of record who wishes to change its vote may do so by voting in accordance with the procedures described in the Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Supplement to Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus
The following information supplements the Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which in turn should be read in its entirety. Page references are to the Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Revised text within the restated language from the Definitive Proxy Statement/Proxy Statement is indicated in bold, underlined text (e.g.,
bold
,
underlined text
).
The following disclosure replaces the first full paragraph on page 31 of the Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus disclosure under the heading“Proposal 4–Approval of the Amended and Restated NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust 2023 Long Term Incentive Plan—Executive Summary and Selected Plan Information—Expected Duration and Impact on Dilution (as measured through burn rate and overhang)”:
The overhang rate is a measure of potential dilution to holders of Old Common Shares. As of April 9, 2025, there were 44,626,539.24 of our Old Common Shares outstanding, 1,934,707 Old Common Shares subject to outstanding full value equity awards, zero Old Common Shares subject to outstanding options or SARs,
30
Old Common Shares remaining under the 2023 Plan and 2,000 common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership (defined below) (the “OP Units”) that were redeemable, subject to certain requirements, for cash or, at the election of Old NXDT, Old Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. If Old NXDT’s overhang rate is calculated including the potential impact of the redemption of the OP Units, then (a) if Old NXDT excludes the impact of the new share request, Old NXDT’s overhang rate as of April 9, 2025 is 4.2% on a fully diluted basis, and (b) if Old NXDT includes the new share request of 943,000 Old Common Shares, Old NXDT’s overhang rate with respect to Old Common Shares will be approximately
6.1
% on a fully diluted basis. If Old NXDT’s overhang rate is calculated excluding the potential impact of the redemption of the OP Units, then (a) if we exclude the impact of the new share request, Old NXDT’s overhang rate as of April 9, 2025 is 4.2% on a fully diluted basis, and (b) if Old NXDT includes the new share request of
943,000
Old Common Shares, Old NXDT’s overhang rate with respect to Old Common Shares will be approximately 6.1% on a fully diluted basis. Old NXDT believes this is a reasonable level of dilution and provides Old NXDT with the appropriate flexibility to ensure meaningful equity awards in future years to executives and other key service providers to better align their interests with the interests of shareholders.

On
May 6, 2025, Cartesian Growth Corporation II (the “Company”) received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department
of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) stating that, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2 (“Rule IM-5101-2”),
the staff of Nasdaq (“Staff”) had determined that (i) the Company’s securities will be delisted from Nasdaq, (ii) trading
of the Company’s Class A common stock, warrants, and units will be suspended at the opening of business on May 13, 2025 and (iii)
a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s securities from listing
and registration on Nasdaq. Under Rule IM-5101-2, a special purpose acquisition company must complete one or more business combinations
within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement. Since the Company failed to complete its
initial business combination by May 5, 2025, the Staff concluded that the Company did not comply with Rule IM-5101-2 and that the Company’s
securities are subject to delisting.
The
Company will not appeal Nasdaq’s determination to delist the Company’s securities and accordingly, the Company’s securities
will be suspended from trading on Nasdaq at the opening of business on May 13, 2025. The Company expects its securities to be quoted on
the over-the-counter market following delisting from Nasdaq. The Company is working diligently to complete an initial business combination
as soon as practicable.
The
Company will remain a reporting entity under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to continued disclosure of
financial and operational information.

As previously disclosed, on August 7, 2024,

a total of twelve additional months, until August 12, 2025, unless the closing of BYNO’s initial business combination shall have
occurred prior thereto.
On May 8, 2025, the Company funded the extension
that had previously been approved by the Board by depositing $40,312 into the Trust Account, thereby extending the time available to the

Important Notice Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains certain“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the proposed Business Combination. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the
words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,”“strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,”“will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar
expressions, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Such statements include, but are not
limited to, statements regarding the proposed Business Combination, including the anticipated initial enterprise value, the benefits of
the proposed Business Combination, integration plans, anticipated future financial and operating performance and results, including estimates
for growth, and the expected timing of the Business Combination. The words “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,”“intend,” “plan” and similar expressions indicate forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, assumptions (including assumptions about
general economic, market, industry and operational factors), known or unknown, which could cause the actual results to vary materially
from those indicated or anticipated. Consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Many factors could cause actual future events
to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Current Report, including but are not limited to: (i) the risk that the
Business Combination may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the price of YHN’s securities;
(ii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the Business Combination, including the approval of the Business Combination
Agreement by the shareholders of YHN; (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination
of the Business Combination Agreement; (iv) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against any of the parties to
the Business Combination Agreement following the announcement of the entry into the Business Combination Agreement and proposed Business
Combination; (v) the ability of the parties to recognize the benefits of the Business Combination Agreement and the proposed Business
Combination; (vi) the lack of useful financial information for an accurate estimate of future capital expenditures and future revenue;
(vii) statements regarding Mingde’s industry and market size; (viii) financial condition and performance of Mingde, including the
anticipated benefits, the implied enterprise value, the expected financial impacts of the Business Combination, potential level of redemptions
of YHN’s public shareholders, the financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, the products, the expected future performance
and market opportunities of Mingde; (ix) the impact from future regulatory, judicial, and legislative changes in Mingde’s industry;
(x) competition from larger companies that have greater resources, technology, relationships and/or expertise; and (xi) those factors
discussed in YHN’s filings with the SEC and that will be contained in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus relating to the
Business Combination. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties that will be described
in the “Risk Factors” section of the definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other documents to be filed by YHN from time
to time with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results
to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they
are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and while Mingde and YHN may elect to update
these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, they assume no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, subject to applicable law. Neither Mingde nor YHN gives any assurance
that Mingde, or YHN, or the combined company, will achieve its expectations.

Offtake Agreement
As previously disclosed, on August 12, 2024, Integrated
Rail and Resources Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“SPAC”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (as amended by that certain Amendment to and Waiver of Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 8, 2024, as further amended
by that certain Second Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 31, 2024, and as further amended by that certain Waiver

Group Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and the other parties thereto (the Merger Agreement, and

As previously disclosed, on November 6, 2024,
SPAC entered into a non-binding letter of intent for a crude supply and offtake agreement with Shell Trading (US) Company (“STUSCO”),
the commencement of which is conditioned upon, among other things, the closing of the Business Combination.
On May 7, 2025, SPAC entered into a Crude Oil
Supply, Offtake, and Processing Agreement with STUSCO (the “Offtake Agreement”). Under the agreement, STUSCO
will be the exclusive supplier of crude oil to SPAC’s Vernal, Utah facility, and the exclusive purchaser of refined products from
the facility, for an initial term of seven years following commencement of operations, with automatic two-year renewal periods thereafter
unless terminated by STUSCO. SPAC is responsible for the restoration and operation of the facility at its own cost and risk, and must
meet certain conditions precedent, including completion of construction and regulatory approvals, before the agreement becomes fully effective.
The agreement provides for pricing based on published market indices with fixed differentials and includes provisions addressing exclusivity,
right of first refusal on facility expansions, most favored nation terms, and customary termination, force majeure, and indemnification
clauses.
The foregoing summary of the Offtake
Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Offtake Agreement, a copy of which is
filed as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Forward-Looking Statements
The information in this current report on Form
8-K includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws with respect to the proposed transaction
between the Company and SPAC. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “plan,”“project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”“believe,” “seek,” “target” or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or
trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements
regarding estimates and forecasts regarding the Company’s business, net proceeds from the proposed transaction, potential benefits
of the proposed transaction and the potential success of the Company’s market and growth strategies, and expectations related to
the terms and timing of the proposed transaction. These statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of
SPAC and the Company’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for
illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance,
a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict
and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of SPAC and the Company. These forward-looking
statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including: (i) the risk that the proposed transaction may not be completed
in a timely manner or at all; (ii) the risk that the proposed transaction may not be completed by SPAC ‘s Business Combination deadline
and the potential failure to obtain an extension of the Business Combination deadline if sought by SPAC; (iii) the failure to satisfy
the conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction, including the approval of the proposed transaction by the stockholders
of SPAC and the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals; (iv) the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the
proposed transaction; (v) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed transaction on the Company’s business relationships,
performance, and business generally; (vi) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against SPAC or the Company related
to the Merger Agreement or the Business Combination; (vii) the ability to address the market opportunity for the Company’s products
and services; (viii) the risk that the proposed transaction may not generate the expected net proceeds for the combined company; (ix)
the ability to implement business plans and other expectations after the completion of the proposed transaction, and identify and realize
additional opportunities; (x) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the
Merger Agreement; (xi) the risk of downturns, new entrants and a changing regulatory landscape in the highly competitive industry in which
the Company operates; and (xii) those factors discussed in SPAC’s filings with the SEC under the headings “Risk Factors,”and other documents of SPAC filed, or to be filed, with the SEC. If any of these risks materialize or the Company’s assumptions
prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional
risks that neither SPAC nor the Company presently know or that SPAC and the Company currently believe are immaterial that could also cause
actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect SPAC’s
and the Company’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this report. While SPAC and the
Company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, each specifically disclaims any obligation to
do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing SPAC’s and the Company’s assessments as
of any date subsequent to the date of this press report. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

Notice of Delisting or Failure to
Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On May 6, 2025, Datavault AI Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”), received a written notification (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department
of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement
for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”),
because the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), was below
$1.00 per share for the previous thirty (30) consecutive business days. The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Common
Stock, which will continue to trade uninterrupted on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker “DVLT.”Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A),
the Company has been granted 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until November 3, 2025 (the “Compliance Period”),
to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time during the Compliance Period, the bid price of the Common
Stock closes at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company with written
confirmation of compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and the matter will be closed.
In the event the Company does not regain compliance
with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by November 3, 2025, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar day grace period.
To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other
initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and will need to provide
written notice to Nasdaq of its intent to regain compliance with such requirement during such second compliance period.
If the Company does not regain compliance within
the allotted compliance period(s), including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Common
Stock will be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market.
The Company intends to continuously monitor the
closing bid price for its Common Stock, and is in the process of considering various measures to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance
with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the
Minimum Bid Price Requirement, even if it maintains compliance with the other Nasdaq listing requirements, or that Nasdaq will grant the
Company any extension of time to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or any other Nasdaq listing requirements, if
applicable.
Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on
Form 8-K (this “Form 8-K”) contains forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to, statements that express the Company’s intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements related
to the Company’s future activities, or future events or conditions, including those related to future compliance with the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement, which can be identified by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,”“aims,” “potential,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”“estimates,” “continue,” “likely to” and other similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking
statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These statements are not historical facts and
are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company’s business based, in part, on assumptions made by
its management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult
to predict, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including risks related to the Company’s ability to regain compliance
with Nasdaq listing standards, the Company’s ability to obtain an additional compliance period, if needed, the Company’s ability
to take actions that may be required for its continued listing on Nasdaq, the Company’s
current
liquidity position and the need to obtain additional financing to support ongoing operations, and other risks
that may be included
in the periodic reports and other filings that the Company files from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore,
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement
to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 8-K, except as required by applicable law."

Pursuant

The CUSIP number for our common stock remains unchanged. Our common stock remains eligible for quotation on the OTC Pink Market and,
in connection with the change in our corporate name, has transitioned to the new ticker symbol, “SSGC,” as of market open
on April 24, 2025.
The
Company also restated its Articles of Incorporation to reflect all prior amendments through April 17, 2025, including the foregoing amendment,
and the text of the resulting Articles of Incorporation is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

NOTICE OF DELISTING OR FAILURE TO SATISFY A CONTINUED LISTING RULE OR STANDARD; TRANSFER OF LISTING.
On May 9, 2025, WW International, Inc. (the “Company” or “we”) received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and
IM-5101-1,
Nasdaq had determined to delist the Company’s common stock as a result of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries commencing voluntary prepackaged cases under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code, on May 6, 2025 (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the Company has the right to appeal Nasdaq’s delisting determination.
The Notice further advises that Nasdaq will suspend trading of the Company’s common stock at the opening of business on May 16, 2025 and that Nasdaq will file a Form
25-NSE
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to effect the delisting of the Company’s common stock unless the Company requests an appeal of this determination. The Company intends to seek to list, on Nasdaq or another national stock exchange, the new common equity of the reorganized Company that is expected to be issued pursuant to the plan of reorganization for the Chapter 11 Cases on or as soon as possible after the emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.
The Company anticipates that following suspension from trading, its common stock will commence trading on the Pink Current Market, operated by OTC Markets Group. The transition to the
over-the-counter
market is not expected to affect the Company’s business operations. The Company can provide no assurance that the common stock will commence or continue to trade on this market, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of the common stock on this market, whether the trading volume of the common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for the common stock will continue on this market in the future.

On
May 9, 2025, Safe Pro Group Inc. (the “Company”) closed on a private offering pursuant to certain Securities Purchase Agreements
(each, an “Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “Investors”), pursuant to which the Investors purchased:
(i) 1,050 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock (the “Preferred Stock”) a price of $1,000 per share of Preferred
Stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.05 million, and (ii) three-year warrants to purchase the number of shares of Company’s
common stock (“Common Stock”) equal to the number of Conversion Shares (defined below) underlying the Preferred Stock on
the date of issuance at an exercise price of $2.93 per share (the “Warrants”).
Series
C Convertible Preferred Stock
In
connection with the signing of the Agreements, the Company designated 2,000 shares of the Company’s authorized and unissued preferred
stock as Series C Preferred Stock and established the rights, preferences and privileges of the Preferred Stock pursuant to the Certificate
of Designations of Rights and Preferences of the Series C Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designations”), which was
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as summarized below:
General
.
Each share of Preferred Stock has a stated value (the “Stated Value”) of $1,100 per share and, when issued, the Preferred
Stock will be fully paid and non-assessable.
Dividends
.
The holders of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive dividends on an as-converted basis equal to and at the time as any dividends
are paid to the holders of the Common Stock.
Conversion
at Option of Holder
. Each holder of Preferred Stock may convert all, or any part, of the Stated Value the outstanding Preferred Stock,
at any time at such holder’s option, into shares of the Common Stock (which converted shares of Common Stock are referred to as“Conversion Shares” herein) at an initial fixed “Conversion Price” of $2.25, which is subject to proportional
adjustment upon the occurrence of any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination and/or similar transactions.
Company
Optional Redemption
. At any time the Company shall have the right to redeem in cash all, or a portion of, the shares of Preferred
Stock then outstanding at a price equal to $1,100 per share of Preferred Stock.
Liquidation
Preference
. Upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive in cash out of the assets of the Company, an amount equal to the Stated Value per share of Preferred Stock, before
any payments are made or distributed to the holders of the Common Stock.
Voting
Rights
. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have no voting power and no right to vote on any matter at any time, either as a
separate series or class or together with any other series or class of share of capital stock.
Warrants
Subject
to certain ownership limitations, each of the Warrants is immediately exercisable, will have an exercise price of $2.93 per share, and
expire three years from the date of issuance. The Warrants may only be exercised on a cashless basis if there is no registration statement
registering, or a prospectus contained therein in not available for, the resale of the shares of common stock underlying the Warrants.
The holder of a Warrant is prohibited from exercising of any such warrants to the extent that such exercise would result in the number
of shares of common stock beneficially owned by such holder and its affiliates exceeding 4.99% or 9.99% (at the election of the Investor)
of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise.
Pursuant
to the Agreement, the Company agreed to use its best efforts to file a registration statement registering the resale of the Common Stock
underlying the Preferred Stock and Warrants within thirty calendar days from the closing.
The
Preferred Stock and Warrants issued in the offering and the shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and exercise of the
Warrants were offered in a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),
and Regulation D promulgated thereunder and have not been registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws.
This
description of the Agreement, Warrant and Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the complete text of the forms of Agreement, Warrant, and of the Certificate of Designations, attached as Exhibits 10.1, 4.1, and
3.1, respectively, of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The
form of Agreement has been attached as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide security holders with information regarding
its terms. Except for its status as a contractual document that establishes and governs the legal relations between the parties with
respect to the transaction described above, the document is not intended to be a source of factual, business or operational information
about the parties. Representations and warranties may be used as a tool to allocate risks between the parties to each Agreement, including
where the parties do not have complete knowledge of all facts, instead of establishing these matters as facts. Furthermore, they may
be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties, which may differ from those applicable to investors. Accordingly,
investors and security holders should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts
or circumstances, because they were only made as of the date of each Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of
such representations and warranties may change after the date of each Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully
reflected in the Company’s public disclosures.

Series A Convertible Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement
On May 7, 2025 (the “Closing Date”), LanzaTech Global, Inc. (the “Company”) and LanzaTech Global SPV, LLC, an entity controlled by a large existing investor (the “Purchaser”), entered into a Series A Convertible Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell 20,000,000 shares of its preferred stock designated as “Series A Convertible Senior Preferred Stock”, par value of $0.0001 per share (“Preferred Stock”), to the Purchaser for an aggregate purchase price of $40,000,000 (the “Preferred Stock Issuance”), subject to certain closing conditions described therein. The Preferred Stock Issuance was consummated on the Closing Date. In connection with the Preferred Stock Issuance, the Company’s $40.2 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Convertible Notes due 2029 (the “Convertible Notes”), plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was converted into 34,054,337 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), of the Company pursuant to the mandatory conversion provision of the Convertible Notes.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company also agreed to issue and sell to the Purchaser, no later than May 31, 2025, warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 780,000,000 shares (“Warrant Shares”) of Common Stock, of the Company, at an exercise price equal to $0.0000001 per Warrant Share (subject to adjustments in certain events, including the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below) and to be no less than par value of the Common Stock) and the other terms to be set forth in a warrant agreement (a form of which is attached as an exhibit to the Purchase Agreement) (the “Warrant Agreement”). Subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement, the Warrants will not be exercisable unless and until, among other things, certain requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Company consummates either a Subsequent Financing (as defined below) or, with the Purchaser’s consent, a financing that does not constitute a Subsequent Financing (an “Other Financing”) (collectively, the “Conditions to Exercise”);
provided
,
however
, that if the Conditions to Exercise are satisfied, each Warrant will be deemed automatically exercised on a cashless, net-exercise basis at such time (the time immediately following such automatic exercise, the “Expiration Time”). The Warrant Agreement will terminate at the earlier of (i) the Expiration Time and (ii) May 7, 2026.
The Purchase Agreement also provides that, no later than 60 days (or 90 days if the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) conducts a review of the applicable preliminary proxy statement) following the Closing Date (the “Approval Deadline”), the Company will be required to convene a meeting of its stockholders to obtain stockholder approvals (collectively, the “Requisite Stockholder Approvals”) with respect to: (i) the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the exercise of the Warrants, and in connection with the Subsequent Financing (collectively, the “Issuable Common Shares”) and to effect any “change of control” in connection with the foregoing, in accordance with the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”); (ii) an amendment the Company’s certificate of incorporation to (a) effect a reverse stock split of the Common Stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”) at a ratio mutually acceptable to the Company and the holders of a majority of the outstanding Preferred Stock (the “Majority Holders”), (b) authorize that number of shares of Common Stock that, taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, is sufficient to authorize and issue Issuable Common Shares (the “Authorized Capitalization Amendment”), (c) set the par value of the Common Stock to an amount equal to the exercise price of the Warrants, and (d) provide that the Company’s stockholders may take action by written consent; and (iii) the issuance of Common Stock in the Subsequent Financing at a price per share of $0.05 (subject to adjustment in certain events, including the Reverse Stock Split). The Purchaser has also agreed in the Purchase Agreement to vote all shares of Common Stock held by it prior to the Closing Date in favor of the Requisite Stockholder Approvals or, if there are insufficient votes in favor of granting the Requisite Stockholder Approvals, in favor of the adjournment of such meeting of the stockholders of the Company to a later date.
Subject only to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approvals, the Company also agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate a bona fide financing pursuant to which the Company sells Common Stock to one or more accredited investors reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Holders, at a price per share of $0.05 (subject to adjustment in certain events, including the Reverse Stock Split), payable in cash, with an aggregate original issue price of not less than $35,000,000 and not more than $60,000,000, on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Holders (the “Subsequent Financing”). The Purchase Agreement provides that the Subsequent Financing must be consummated, if at all, no later than 10 business days following receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approvals.
Terms of the Preferred Stock
2
The Preferred Stock will rank senior to the Common Stock in priority of payment in all respects, including with respect to payment of dividends, distribution of assets, distributions in connection with any Liquidation Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designation governing the terms of the Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designation”), and including certain bankruptcy and insolvency related events) or Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designation and including a change of control transaction and the sale of all or substantially all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries), and all other redemption rights. The Preferred Stock has an initial original issue price of $2.00 per share (“Initial Liquidation Value”). Dividends on the Preferred Stock will accumulate daily at a rate of 8% per annum, on the basis of actual days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Dividends will accrue quarterly in arrears and, once accrued, shall not be paid in cash but shall be added to the Liquidation Value of such shares.
Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof (with respect to its shares) or at the option of the Majority Holders (on behalf of all holders), into one fully-paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in certain events, including the Reverse Stock Split) without the payment of additional consideration by the holder. Prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approvals, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be limited as described in the Certificate of Designation.
Upon the occurrence of certain “Mandatory Redemption Events” (as defined and further described in the Certificate of Designation and including, among other things, a change of control, a Liquidation Event, a Deemed Liquidation Event, failure to approve the Authorized Capitalization Amendment and certain covenant breaches), the Company is required to make an irrevocable and unconditional offer to holders of the Preferred Stock to redeem all of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Redemption”). The redemption price for each share of Preferred Stock redeemed in a Mandatory Redemption is equal to an amount per share of 1.5x its Liquidation Value as of the relevant date of determination. Upon the occurrence of certain Liquidation Events, all outstanding Preferred Stock will be deemed automatically surrendered to the Company, redeemed and extinguished in exchange for a promissory note (a form of which is attached as an exhibit to the Purchase Agreement).
The Preferred Stock is not redeemable at the election of the Company. From and after the date on which both (i) certain conditions with respect to an Other Financing have been satisfied and (ii) the Warrant Shares have been issued, none of the shares of Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the election of the holders thereof.
Subject to the limitations set forth in the Certificate of Designations (including as it relates to the limitation of voting power prior to the Requisite Stockholder Approvals), each holder of Preferred Stock is entitled to cast three votes per each share of Common Stock into which the Preferred Stock are convertible. In addition, for so long as the Preferred Stock remains outstanding, the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to elect, voting together as a separate class and on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, one director on the Company’s board of directors (“Board”) and to fill any vacancies with respect to such director.
The Certificate of Designation provides for certain “most favored nation” treatment to holders of the Preferred Stock, including that the Majority Holders may request that Company amend and restate the Certificate of Designation or any other organizational document to provide that the designations, preferences and privileges in respect of the Preferred Stock are no less favorable than the terms of any other financing (other than the Subsequent Financing).
The Certificate of Designation also provides that, without the consent of the Majority Holders and subject to certain exceptions described therein, the Company may not (i) consummate any financing, except for the Subsequent Financing; (ii) amend, alter or repeal its certificate of incorporation or its bylaws in a manner that adversely affects the Preferred Stock; (iii) create, authorize or issue new equity interests; (iv) increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of Common Stock (other than the Requisite Stockholder Approval) or Preferred Stock; (v) purchase or redeem or pay or declare any dividend on any shares of the Company’s capital stock; (vi) create, or hold capital stock in, non-wholly owned subsidiaries; (vii) change the number of votes entitled to be cast by directors; (viii) incur, or cause or permit any subsidiary to incur, indebtedness or liens; (ix) change in any material respect the compensation or benefits of any executive officer; (x) enter into certain related party transactions; (xi) sell, lease, transfer, exclusively license or dispose of certain material assets; (xii) consummate certain investments outside the ordinary course of business and (xiii) materially change the nature of the Company or its subsidiaries’ businesses.
Additional Agreements
On the Closing Date and in connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Purchaser entered into the Investors’ Rights Agreement (the “Investors Rights Agreement”) and the Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”). The Investors Rights Agreement sets forth certain rights and obligations of the Purchaser, including the right to elect one director of the Company, the Purchaser’s obligation to vote the Common Stock underlying its Preferred Shares in support of certain matters set forth therein, certain information rights, and certain restrictions on transfer of the Preferred Shares. The Registration Rights Agreement grants the Purchaser customary registration rights with respect to the
3
Preferred Shares and Warrant Shares and requires the Company to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), such shares within the deadlines set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.
The foregoing summaries of the Certificate of Designation, the Purchase Agreement, the Investors Rights Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement (collectively, the “Transaction Documents”) do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the full text of such Transaction Documents, copies of which are being filed as Exhibits 3.3, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and are incorporated by reference herein.

Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties.
Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The information in Item 1.01 is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.
As described in Item 1.01, the Company issued the Preferred Shares to the Purchaser on the Closing Date and agreed to issue and sell the Warrants to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Warrant Agreement. The offer and sale of the Preferred Shares and the Warrants (including the Warrant Shares) are being made in reliance an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof.
The issuance of the shares of Common Stock to the holders of the Convertible Note was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof.
Item 3.03. Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
The information in Item 1.01 regarding the voting rights of the Preferred Stock is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.03.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
Alongside the Preferred Stock Issuance and related transactions, the Company is continuing to implement strategic measures to scale its global business with greater cost efficiency to support its transition from a research and development-centric company to a commercially focused enterprise. In connection therewith, Company will notify certain of its employees out of its Skokie, Illinois location of an anticipated workforce reduction and provide related governmental notices in order to comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and similar state law.

Departure of Directors
On May 8, 2025, each of Frederick D. DiSanto and Stephen E. Paul informed the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (the “Corporation”) of their intention to step down from the Board of the Corporation as directors of the class of 2026, effective as of May 15, 2025. Mr. DiSanto will step down from the Finance and Investment Committee of the Board, and Mr. Paul will step down from the Compensation and Finance and Investment Committees at the same time.  The decision of neither Mr. DiSanto nor Mr. Paul to step down from the Board is the result of any dispute or disagreement with the Corporation or its Board.
With the resignations of Mr. DiSanto and Mr. Paul from the Board, the Board has determined to return the size of the Board to eight (8) directors, down from ten (10) directors, effective upon their resignations.
Approval of 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as Amended and Restated)
On March 6, 2025, the Board, subject to shareholder approval, approved the Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “Plan”). The Plan is currently the Corporation’s only plan providing for the issuance of equity-based awards. The Compensation Committee of the Board administers the Plan to provide future grants of stock options and other share-based awards to the Corporation’s directors, officers and employees. On May 8, 2025, shareholders holding a majority of the common stock, $1.00 par value (the “common stock”) of the Corporation voted in favor of the amendment to the Plan.
The Compensation Committee of the Board recommended amending the Plan after reviewing the Plan and, based on that review, determining that an insufficient number of shares were available under the Plan. This amendment and restatement of the Plan increases the number of shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the plan by 500,000 shares. The additional shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock authorized to be delivered under the Plan pursuant to the amendment are expected to be registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8.
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
On May 8, 2025, the Corporation held its annual meeting of shareholders. The following are the voting results for the proposals that were voted upon by the Corporation’s shareholders at that meeting:

Discovery of and Response to Cybersecurity Incident
On May 5, 2025, Global Crossing Airlines Group Inc. (the “Company”) learned of unauthorized activity within its computer networks and systems supporting portions of its business applications, which the Company determined to be the result of a cybersecurity incident. Upon learning of this activity, the Company immediately (1) activated its incident response protocols and third-party cybersecurity experts to assist with containment and mitigation activities and to investigate the nature and scope of the incident and (2) took actions to contain and isolate the affected servers and prevent further intrusion. The Company also promptly notified law enforcement and is coordinating fully with them.
Given the recency of the incident, our investigation and response are ongoing, and the full scope, nature, and potential ultimate impact on the Company are not yet known. The Company currently believes that none of its operations have been disrupted or negatively impacted by this incident. Although the Company is unable to predict the full impact of this incident, the Company does not expect the incident will have a material effect on the Company, or its financial condition or results of operations.

(the “Company”) was notified by the listing qualifications staff of the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) of its determination that the Company had not regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and was not eligible for a second 180-day period within which to regain compliance. The listing staff further notified the Company that, unless the Company requested an appeal of determination by May 14, 2025, the Company’s securities would be scheduled for delisting from Nasdaq and suspended at the opening of business on May 16, 2025, and that Nasdaq would file a Form 25-NSE with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq.
As described in more detail in Item 8.01 below, the Company has subsequently regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and the matter is now closed.
Item 8.01
Other Events.
On May 9, 2025, the Company was notified by the listing qualifications staff of Nasdaq that the Company complies with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The listing qualifications staff had notified the Company on November 4, 2024, that it did not comply with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for 30 consecutive business days, as required under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for the Nasdaq Capital Market, and on May 7, 2025, that it had not regained compliance prior to the 180-day deadline and therefore would be scheduled for delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company appealed the determination as described in more detail in Item 3.01 above. Because the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock has been at $1.00 per share or greater for the last ten consecutive business days, from April 25 to May 8, 2025, the staff has determined that the Company complies with the Rules and this matter is now closed.

3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On
May 6, 2025, NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation (the “Company”) received a letter (the “Notice”)
from the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”)
notifying the Company that because the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock was below $1.00 per share for the prior
30 consecutive business days, the Company is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq
Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”).
In
accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has a period of 180 calendar days from May 6, 2025, or until November
3, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time before November 3, 2025, the closing bid price of
the Company’s common stock closes at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days (which number days
may be extended by Nasdaq), Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance with the Minimum Bid Price
Requirement, and the matter would be resolved.
The
Notice also disclosed that in the event the Company does not regain compliance with the Rule by November 3, 2025, the Company may be
eligible for additional time. To qualify for additional time, the Company would be required to meet the applicable market value of publicly
held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable standards for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, with
the exception of the bid price requirement, and would need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the
second compliance period. If the Company meets these requirements, Nasdaq will inform the Company that it has been granted an additional
180 calendar days. However, if it appears to the Staff that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is
otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company’s securities will be subject to delisting.
The
Company intends to continue actively monitoring the closing bid price for the Company’s common stock between now and November 3,
2025, and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If
the Company does not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period, including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq,
Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company’s common stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would then be entitled to
appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. There can be no assurance that the Company will regain compliance with the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement during the 180-day compliance period, secure a second period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance, or maintain
compliance with the other Nasdaq listing requirements.

On May 6, 2025, Vince Holding Corp. (the ""Company"") received a written notice (the ""Notice"") from the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") that the Company did not presently satisfy the NYSE's continued listing standards under Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the ""Manual""), which requires the Company's 30-trading day average market capitalization to be not less than $50 million and the Company's stockholders' equity to be not less than $50 million.  As set forth in the Notice, as of May 5, 2025, the Company's 30-trading day average market capitalization was approximately $22.6 million and the Company's last reported stockholders' equity as of February 1, 2025 was approximately $41.8 million.
In accordance with applicable NYSE procedures, within 45 days from receipt of the Notice, the Company must submit to the NYSE a business plan that demonstrates compliance with Section 802.01B of the Manual.  The Listings Operations Committee of the NYSE will review the business plan and will either accept the plan, at which time the Company will be subject to ongoing quarterly monitoring for compliance with the business plan, or reject the business plan, at which time the Company will be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings.  The Company expects to timely submit such a business plan to the NYSE.
Pursuant to the NYSE rules, the Company's common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the cure periods outlined above, subject to the Company's compliance with other applicable continued listing requirements.  The current noncompliance with the standards described above does not affect the Company's ongoing business operations or its reporting requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").
No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to regain compliance with this requirement or maintain compliance with the other continued listing requirements in the Manual.  If the Company's common stock ultimately were to be suspended from trading and delisted for any reason, it could have adverse consequences including, among other things, reduced trading liquidity of the common stock, lower demand and market price for shares of the Company's common stock, adverse publicity and a reduced interest in the Company from investors, analysts and other market participants.  In addition, a suspension or delisting could impair the Company's ability to raise additional capital through the public markets and the Company's ability to attract and retain employees by means of equity compensation.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 9, 2025, the Company issued a press release announcing receipt of the Notice.  The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
The information, including Exhibit 99.1 hereto, which the Company furnished under Item 7.01 of this report is not deemed ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.  Registration statements or other documents filed with the SEC shall not incorporate this information by reference, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
.
On May 8, 2025, Sunnova Energy International Inc. (the “Company”) and the other parties to the Forbearance Agreement (as defined below) agreed by email correspondence to an extension (the “Amendment”) of that certain Forbearance Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2025 (the “Forbearance Agreement”), by and among the Company, Sunnova Energy Corporation (“SEC”), Sunnova Intermediate Holdings, LLC and certain beneficial holders or investment managers or advisors for such beneficial holders (collectively, the “Supporting Holders”) of SEC’s 11.750% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “11.750% Notes”) and SEC’s 5.875% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “5.875% Notes” and, together with the 11.750% Notes, the “Notes”), relating to the Notes.
As previously announced, the Company elected to defer making an interest payment on the 11.750% Notes of approximately $23.5 million due on April 1, 2025 (the “Specified Default”) and enter the 30-day grace period under the indenture governing the 11.750% Notes (the “11.750% Notes Indenture”), which expired on May 1, 2025. Pursuant to the 11.750% Notes Indenture, a failure to make the interest payment by the expiration of the grace period constitutes an “Event of Default” under such indenture, which would entitle the trustee under the 11.750% Notes Indenture or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 11.750% Notes to accelerate the maturity thereof. An Event of Default under the 11.750% Notes Indenture causes a cross-default under the indenture governing the 5.875% Notes (the “5.875% Notes Indenture” and such default, the “Cross-Default”), which would entitle the trustee under such indenture or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5.875% Notes to accelerate the maturity thereof.
As previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 2, 2025, the Forbearance Agreement provided that, from May 2, 2025 until May 8, 2025,
or the occurrence of another Event of Termination (as defined in the Forbearance Agreement)
(the “Forbearance Period”), the Supporting Holders would (i) forbear from exercising any of their rights and remedies, including with respect to an acceleration, under 5.875% Notes Indenture or 11.750% Notes Indenture, as applicable, or applicable law with respect to the Specified Default and the Cross-Default and (ii) in the event that the applicable trustee or any holder or group of holders declares the Notes to be due and payable immediately (an “Acceleration”) during the Forbearance Period, to deliver written notice to the applicable trustee to rescind such Acceleration and its consequences and take all other action in their power to cause such Acceleration to be rescinded and annulled. In addition, during the Forbearance Period, each Supporting Holder (severally and not jointly) agreed that it (individually or collectively) will not deliver any notice or instruction to the applicable trustee directing the applicable trustee to exercise during the Forbearance Period any of the rights and remedies under 5.875% Notes Indenture or 11.750% Notes Indenture, as applicable, or applicable law with respect to the Specified Default and the Cross-Default.
During the Forbearance Period, each of the Supporting Holders is prohibited from transferring the 5.875% Notes or 11.750% Notes, as applicable, except to a party who is already a Supporting Holder or who, prior to such transfer, agrees to be bound by all of the terms of the Forbearance Agreement.
The Amendment extends the Forbearance Period until the earlier of (i) May 15, 2025 and (ii)
the occurrence of another Event of Termination
.

As
previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 8, 2024, TruGolf Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) previously
received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) notifying the
Company that the listing of its Class A common stock was not in compliance with the minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (the“MVPHS”) requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) for continued listing on Nasdaq. Nasdaq Listing Rule
5450(b)(2)(C) requires the minimum MVPHS of $15,000,000, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C) provides that a failure to meet the minimum
MVPHS requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Nasdaq stated in its letter that in
accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date of the notice
(“Compliance Period”)
Also,
as previously disclosed on our Form 8-K filed on November 8, 2024, the Company previously received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the
Company that, for the 30 consecutive business days ended November 4, 2024, the Company’s Class A common stock did not maintain
a minimum bid price of $1 per share (the “Bid Price Requirement”). The Company had until the end of the Compliance Period
to meet the regain compliance with the bid price deficiency.
On
May 7, 2025, the Company received written notice (the “Nasdaq Notice”) from Nasdaq stating that the Company has not regained
compliance with the MVPHS requirement or the bid price requirement.
The
Company previously received a delist determination letter from Nasdaq regarding its failure to maintain stockholders’ equity of
at least $10,000,000 for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. The Company subsequently requested a hearing before a Nasdaq
hearing panel (the “Panel”), and such hearing has been set for May 15, 2025. The hearing request automatically stayed the
suspension and/or delisting of the Company’s securities pending completion of the hearing and the expiration of any additional
extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. The Company intends to present at the hearing a plan to regain compliance
with all the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, including the MVPHS requirement and the bid price requirement.
The
Nasdaq Notice was Nasdaq’s formal notification to the Company that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) will consider
this matter in rendering a determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. Pursuant to Listing
Rule 5810(d), the Company is permitted to present its views with respect to this additional deficiency at its Panel hearing. If the Company
fails to address the aforementioned issue, the Panel will consider the record as presented at the hearing and will make its determination
based upon that information. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request or that the Company will
ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing."

Sales of Equity Securities
As previously disclosed,
between January 2023 and November 2023, EON Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into note and
warrant purchase agreements (“Purchase Agreements”) with certain accredited investors (the “Investors”) whereby
the Investors purchased promissory notes with principal amounts equal to the purchase price (the “Old Notes”) and warrants
to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”),
equal to three-fourths of the purchase price (the “Old Warrants”).
On May 8, 2025, the Company
and 11 of the Investors (the “Exchange Investors”) entered into exchange agreements (the “Exchange Agreements”)
whereby the Exchange Investors exchanged their Old Notes and Old Warrants for convertible promissory notes (the “Convertible Notes”).
The principal amounts of the Convertible Notes were determined by adding the original principal amount of the Old Notes and the number
of Old Warrants. In connection with the Exchange Agreements, the Company issued Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$6,850,000 in exchange for Old Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,900,000 and 3,950,000 Old Warrants.
The Convertible Notes
mature on January 31, 2028 and accrue interest at a rate of 7.5% per annum. The Convertible Notes may be prepaid by the Company at any
time, in whole or in part, without any premium or penalty. The Convertible Notes may be converted by the holders at any time after issuance
into shares of Class A Common Stock at a conversion price equal to the greater of (a) $0.25 per share or (b) 90% multiplied by the average
of the three lowest VWAPs of the Class A Common Stock over the ten trading days prior to conversion (the “Conversion Price”).
If, at any time the Convertible Notes are outstanding, the Company issues or sells Class A Common Stock for no consideration or at a price
lower than the then-current Conversion Price, then the Conversion Price of the Convertible Notes will be automatically reduced to the
amount of consideration per share received by the Company in such sale or offering. In addition, so long as any Convertible Notes are
outstanding, if the Company issues any security on terms more favorable than the Convertible Notes, then the Company must notify the holder
and such more favorable term shall become a part of the Convertible Note, at the holder’s option
The Exchange Agreement
and the Convertible Notes each also contain customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions.
The foregoing is a summary
description of certain terms of the Exchange Agreements and the Convertible Notes. For a full description of all terms, please refer to
the copies of the form of Exchange Agreement and the form of Convertible Note that are filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2,
respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
The Company has issued the Convertible Notes pursuant
to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), available
under Section 3(a)(9) and intends to issue any shares upon conversion of the Convertible Note pursuant to such exemption. The Exchange
Investors are each an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
This Current Report on
Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall such securities be offered or sold in
the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements and certificates evidencing such shares
contain a legend stating the same.

Item 5.03
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On May 6, 2025, ReShape Lifesciences Inc. (the“Company”) filed a Certificate of Amendment (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-25
reverse split of the Company’s outstanding common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The
Reverse Stock Split became effective for trading purposes upon the commencement of trading on May 9, 2025, at which point the Company’s
common stock began trading on a split adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each 25 shares
of issued and outstanding common stock and equivalents were converted into one share of common stock. Any fractional shares of common
stock resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share.
As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, proportional
adjustments were made to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion, and the per share exercise or conversion
price, of the Company’s outstanding warrants, stock options and convertible preferred stock, in each case in accordance with their
terms.
The Reverse Stock Split does not reduce the number
of authorized shares of common stock and preferred stock under the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, the effect of the Reverse
Stock Split is to increase the number of shares of common stock and preferred stock available for issuance relative to the number of shares
issued and outstanding. The Reverse Stock Split does not alter the par value of the common stock or preferred stock or modify any voting
rights or other terms of the common stock or any series of preferred stock. The Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company’s
stockholders at its special meeting of stockholders held on April 1, 2025.

The

Company to the Buyers in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the“Securities Act”) in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D thereunder. In the
Securities Purchase Agreement, the Buyers represented to the Company, among other things, that they are “accredited investor”(as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act). Accordingly, the offer and sale by the Company of
the securities that may be issued and sold to the Buyers under the Securities Purchase Agreement have not been and will not be registered

Also during this same period, there were no reportable events within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions thereto.
The Company has provided WWC with the disclosures under this Item 4.01(a) and has requested WWC to furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the Company in this Item 4.01(a) and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree.

Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 7, 2025, the Company entered into consulting agreements (collectively, the “May Consulting Agreements”) with each of Huey Co. LLC, PC2ATX, LLC, McMillan Co., Skeleton Crew Labs LLC, and Z-List Media, Inc. (together with Bristol (as defined below) the “Consultants”), pursuant to which each Consultant will assist the Company with, among other things, crypto portfolio management; investor relations; strategic planning; deal flow analysis and advice related to sector growth initiatives (the “Services”). Each May Consulting Agreement has a term of one year.
On May 7, 2025, the Company also entered into a Fourth Amendment to Consulting Agreement with Bristol Capital, LLC (“Bristol”), which amended the existing consulting agreement between the Company and Bristol (as amended, the “Bristol Consulting Agreement” and together with the May Consulting Agreements, the “Consulting Agreements”) to provide for Bristol to perform additional Services to the Company.
In connection with the Consulting Agreements, the Company issued to each Consultant warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), per Consultant, consisting of (i) a warrant to purchase up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.05 per share, which was the closing price of the Common Stock immediately prior to the execution of the Consulting Agreements, as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, (ii) a warrant to purchase up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share, and (iii) a warrant to purchase up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share (collectively, the “Warrants”).
The Warrants are each exercisable immediately and will expire five years after the date of issuance. The exercise price of each Warrant and number of shares underlying such Warrant are subject to standard adjustments in the event of certain events, such as stock splits, combinations, dividends, distributions, reclassifications, mergers or other corporate changes.
Holders of the Warrants (together with such holder’s affiliates) may not exercise any portion of any Warrant to the extent that such holder would beneficially own more than 4.99% (or 9.99%, at the election of the holder) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after exercise, except that upon at least 61 days’ prior notice from the holder to the Company, such holder may increase the amount of beneficial ownership of outstanding shares after exercising such holder’s Warrants up to 9.99% of the number of the Company’s shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise.
The Company has agreed to file a registration statement to register the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants (the “Warrant Shares”) within 90 days following the issuance of the Warrants, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause such additional registration statement to be declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) within 120 days following such issuance date (the “Effectiveness Deadline”).
If Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis after the Effectiveness Deadline if, at the time of exercise, the resale of the Warrant Shares is not covered by an effective registration statement (or the prospectus contained therein is not available for use). The Warrants may not be exercised on a cashless basis any time prior to the Effectiveness Deadline or at any time at which the resale of the Warrant Shares is covered by an effective registration statement.
The offer and sale of the Warrants and the Warrant Shares was made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Such offer and sale was made only to “accredited investors” under Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, and without any form of general solicitation and with full access to any information requested by such investors regarding the Company or the securities offered.
This report does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities in the described offering, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
The foregoing descriptions of the Warrants, the May Consulting Agreements and the Bristol Consulting Agreement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

(a) Dismissal of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm
On May 5, 2025, the Audit Committee (the “Audit
Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Digital Ally, Inc. (the “Company”) approved the dismissal of RBSM LLP (“RBSM”)
as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.
The reports of RBSM on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion,
and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that RBSM’s reports on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company as of and for the years December 31, 2024 contained an explanatory paragraph stating that “The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred substantial operating losses and will require additional
capital to continue as a going concern. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.”During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and
2023, and through May 5, 2025, there have been no “disagreements” (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and
related instructions) with RBSM on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope
or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of RBSM would have caused RBSM to make reference thereto in its
reports on the consolidated financial statements for such years. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and through
May 5, 2025, there have been no “reportable events” (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
The Company provided RBSM with a copy
of the disclosure it is making herein in response to Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K, and requested that RBSM to furnish the Company with
a copy of its letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), pursuant to Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation
S-K, stating whether or not RBSM agrees with the statements related to them made by the Company in this report. A copy of RBSM’s
letter to the SEC dated May 7, 2025 is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this report.
(b) Appointment of New Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm
On May 5, 2025, the Audit Committee approved the appointment
of Victor Mokuolu CPA PLLC (“Mokuolu”) as the Company’s new independent registered public accounting firm, effective
immediately, to perform independent audit services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. During the fiscal years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023 and through May 5, 2025, neither the Company, nor anyone on its behalf, consulted Mokuolu regarding either (i) the application
of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered
with respect to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company
by Mokuolu that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting
issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a “disagreement” (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and
the related instructions) or a “reportable event” (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

Other Events.
On May 7, 2025, the Ontario Securities Commission issued a

Specifically,
the restated Section 2.09 states that “The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these Bylaws, subject to Section 217 (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors
and joint owners of stock) and Section 218 (relating to voting trusts and other voting agreements) of the DGCL. Except as may be otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by
such stockholder. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or the rules and regulations of
any applicable stock exchange, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter, voting affirmatively
or negatively (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes), shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise required by law,
the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange, directors shall be elected
by a plurality of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of directors. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, in all matters other than the election
of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast by the stockholders of such class or series or classes or series
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, voting affirmatively or negatively (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes),
shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series, except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation,
these Bylaws, or the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange.”The
foregoing description of the First Amendment is qualified by reference to the First Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as

On
May 5, 2025, Greenlane Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department
of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), stating that based on its review of the Company’s public filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), its staff has determined to delist the Company’s securities pursuant
to its discretionary authority under Listing Rule 5101. Specifically, as set forth in the letter, Nasdaq’s staff determined that
the Company’s issuance of securities pursuant to the securities purchase agreement dated February 18, 2025, particularly the Series
B warrants exercisable on an alternate cashless basis as described in the Company’s prior SEC filings, raises public interest
concerns because the issuance resulted in substantial dilution for its shareholders. Accordingly, as set forth in the letter, this matter
serves as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq.
The
letter serves as a formal notification that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) will consider this matter in rendering
a determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on Nasdaq. Pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(d), the Company should present
its views with respect to this additional deficiency at its upcoming Panel hearing.
The
Company plans to submit a compliance plan to the Panel. The Company also plans to apply for trading on the OTCQB market maintained by
OTC Markets Group Inc. to address the risk of delisting from Nasdaq in the event of an unfavorable Panel decision.
