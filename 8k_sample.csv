On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company, that the USG requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of the Companys H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. The USG indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China. On April 14, 2025, the USG informed the Company that the license requirement will be in effect for the indefinite future.
The Companys first quarter of fiscal year 2026 ends on April 27, 2025. First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.

Reported GAAP earnings and adjusted non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2025 are expected to include acquired IPR&D and milestones expense of $248 million on a pre-tax basis, representing an unfavorable impact of $0.13 to both GAAP diluted earnings per share and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Results for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 have not been finalized and are subject to our financial statement closing procedures. There can be no assurance that our final results will not differ from these preliminary estimates.
While acquired IPR&D and milestones expense may be incurred upon execution of collaborations, licensing agreements, and other asset acquisitions, AbbVie does not forecast acquired IPR&D and milestones expense due to uncertainty of the future occurrence and timing of these transactions. Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2025 previously announced on January31, 2025 excluded the impact of acquired IPR&D and milestones expense that may be incurred in 2025. AbbVies full-year 2025 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range, including the impact of first quarter 2025 acquired IPR&D and milestones expense, is $11.99 - $12.19. AbbVies first quarter 2025 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range, including the impact of first quarter 2025 acquired IPR&D and milestones expense, is $2.34 - $2.38. This guidance does not reflect the impact related to AbbVie and Gubras licensing agreement to develop GUB014295, as that transaction closed after the first quarter of 2025.
Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference is guidance for 2025 including the estimated acquired IPR&D and milestones expense incurred during the first quarter of 2025.

On February11, 2025, the Section16 Subcommittee (the Subcommittee) of the Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee) of the Board of Directors of
T-Mobile
US, Inc. (the Company) approved the grant, effective as of April1, 2025, of stock-settled performance-based restricted stock units (the PRSUs) under the Companys 2023 Incentive Award Plan (the Plan) to Mark W. Nelson (Executive Vice President and General Counsel), Michael J. Katz (President, Marketing, Strategy and Products), Jonathan A. Freier (President, Consumer Group), Callie R. Field (President, Business Group) and Ulf Ewaldsson (President, Technology) (collectively, the executives). The following is a description of the material terms and conditions of the PRSUs.
General
. Each executive is eligible to vest in a number of PRSUs ranging from 80% to 120% of the target number of PRSUs granted, based on the Companys core adjusted EBITDA during the
one-year
performance period commencing on January1, 2027 and ending on (and including) December31, 2027 (the performance period), subject to the executives continued employment with the Company and its affiliates through April1, 2028 (the vesting date). Each vested PRSU represents the right to receive payment in the form of one share of common stock of the Company.
Vesting
. Up to 120% of the target number of PRSUs subject to each award will be eligible to vest based on the Companys core adjusted EBITDA during the performance period compared to the Companys target core adjusted EBITDA for the performance period, as set forth in the applicable PRSU award agreement.
Following the completion of the performance period, the Compensation Committee or the Subcommittee will determine the Companys core adjusted EBITDA and the number of PRSUs that have become earned with respect to the performance period (such PRSUs, the performance-vested PRSUs). The performance-vested PRSUs will become fully vested on the vesting date, subject to the applicable executives continued service through such date. Any PRSUs that do not become earned and vested will be forfeited without consideration therefor.
Certain Terminations of Employment.
If an executives service terminates prior to the vesting date due to the executives death or disability (as defined in the Plan), any then-unvested PRSUs will vest at target performance as of the termination date.
If an executive incurs a termination of service prior to the vesting date as a result of a workforce reduction, a divestiture or due to a termination by the Company or its affiliates without cause (excluding death or disability) or a resignation by the executive for good reason (each such term as defined in the applicable PRSU award agreement), a
pro-rated
number of PRSUs (based on the number of days that the executive was employed during the period beginning on the grant date and ending on the vesting date) will vest based on actual performance upon completion of the performance period, and any remaining unearned PRSUs will be cancelled and forfeited upon completion of the performance period. Such vesting is subject to the applicable executives execution of a release of claims or other documents required by the Company or the terms of any applicable Company severance program.
In addition, if the applicable executive incurs a termination of service prior to the vesting date by the Company or its affiliates without cause (other than due to death or disability) or due to his or her resignation for good reason, in either case, within one year following a change in control of the Company (as defined in the Plan), the PRSUs will become earned and vested as of the date of such termination at (i)the target level of performance or (ii)solely if such change in control occurs during the performance period, the greater of (x)the target level of performance or (y)the actual level of performance, determined as if the performance period had ended as of the last trading day immediately preceding such change in control.
If an executives employment terminates prior to the vesting date for any reason other than those described above, such executives PRSUs will be cancelled and forfeited as of the date of such termination.
Change of Control
. If a change of control of the Company occurs prior to the vesting date, the PRSUs are assumed, converted or replaced by the surviving entity in the change in control and the applicable executive remains in continued employment or service with the Company through the vesting date, the number of PRSUs that become earned with respect to the performance period will not be less than the number of PRSUs that would be earned based on the target level of performance.
Payment
. Each PRSU that becomes vested will be paid to the executive in shares of common stock within ninety days following the date on which such PRSU vests or, if earlier, by March 15th of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of vesting.
Awards
. The following amounts represent the minimum number of PRSUs granted to the executives, which is equal to 80% of target:

On April16, 2025,
Abbott Laboratories announced its results of operations for the first quarter 2025.
Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others, net earnings excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as expenses primarily associated with acquisitions, restructuring actions, fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration related to business acquisitions, impairment charges related to equity investments, certain regulatory costs, adjustments related to prior recognition of a significant non-cash deferred tax benefit, tax benefits associated with specified items, net tax expense as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs, similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance. Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, effective beginning with our first quarter of 2025, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to conform with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of, and allocates resources to, these segments. In North America, the food businesses, Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods North America are now reported together as PepsiCo Foods North America. These changes do not impact our PepsiCo Beverages North America segment. Internationally, the foods businesses have been reorganized into three reportable segments: Latin America Foods, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific Foods (previously referred to as Other International Foods). Asia Pacific Foods now includes the foods businesses in our former Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (APAC) segment and India, previously part of our former Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA) segment. Our international franchise beverage businesses that were part of our former Latin America, Europe, AMESA and APAC segments are now reported as International Beverages Franchise. The company-owned bottling businesses operating internationally are all located within EMEA and are now reported in the newly created EMEA segment.
Our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been recast to reflect our current organizational structure.

Attached as an exhibit hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated April22, 2025, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon).
Non-GAAP Measures
Verizons press release and financial tables attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.
EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors.
Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income.
Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a companys operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization and legacy legal matter. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision
to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses, as part of our continued transformation initiatives.
Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon.
We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2025.
Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio
Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizons ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations.
Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months.
Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast
Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period.
Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and legacy legal matter.
We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisitions purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets.
We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2025.
Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Forecast
Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow forecast is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures forecast (including capitalized software) from forecasted net cash provided by operating activities.
See the accompanying schedules for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Current Report on Form 8-K (including the exhibits attached hereto) includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.  The forward-looking statements, which address the Companys current expectations regarding business and financial performance, including managements outlook for 2025, among other matters, contain words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, plan, aim, will, may, should, could, would, likely, continue and similar expressions.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:
the Companys ability to achieve its 2025 earnings per common share (EPS) outlook and grow EPS in the future, which will depend in part on revenue growth, credit performance, credit reserve levels and the effective tax rate remaining consistent with current expectations and the Companys ability to continue investing at high levels in areas that can drive sustainable growth (including its brand, value propositions, coverage, marketing, technology and talent), controlling operating expenses, effectively managing risk and executing its share repurchase program, any of which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the subsequent paragraphs as well as the following: macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including the effects of announced or future tariff increases, global trade relations, changes to consumer and business confidence, international tensions, hostilities and instability, a slowdown in U.S. or global economic growth, higher rates of unemployment, changes in interest rates, inflation, supply chain issues, market volatility, energy costs and fiscal and monetary policies; the impact of any future contingencies, including, but not limited to, legal costs and settlements, the imposition of fines or monetary penalties, increases in Card Member remediation, investment gains or losses, restructurings, impairments and changes in reserves; issues impacting brand perceptions and the Companys reputation; impacts related to acquisitions, cobrand and other partner agreements, portfolio sales and joint ventures; and the impact of regulation and litigation, which may be heightened due to the uncertain political environment and could affect the profitability of the Companys business activities, limit the Companys ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter the Companys relationships with Card Members, partners and merchants;
the Companys ability to achieve its 2025 revenue growth outlook and grow revenues net of interest expense in the future, which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified above and in the subsequent paragraphs, as well as the following: spending volumes and the spending environment not being consistent with expectations, including a decline or slowdown in cross-border and travel & entertainment spending volumes, as well as spending by U.S. consumer and small and mid-sized enterprise Card Members, such as due to uncertain business and economic conditions; an inability to address competitive pressures, attract and retain customers, invest in and enhance the Companys Membership Model of premium products, differentiated services and partnerships, successfully refresh its card products, grow spending and lending with customers across age cohorts, including Millennial and Gen-Z customers, and implement strategies and business initiatives, including within the premium consumer space, commercial payments and the global network; the effects of regulatory initiatives, including pricing and network

the Companys ability to expand its leadership in the premium consumer space, including with Millennial and Gen-Z consumers, which will be impacted in part by competition, brand perceptions (including perceptions related to merchant coverage) and reputation, and the Companys ability to develop and market new benefits and value propositions that appeal to Card Members and new customers, grow spending with new and younger age cohort Card Members, offer attractive services and rewards programs and build greater customer loyalty, which will depend in part on identifying and funding investment opportunities, addressing changing customer behaviors, new product innovation and development, Card Member acquisition efforts and enrollment processes, including through digital channels, continuing to realize the benefits from strategic partnerships, successfully implementing the Companys dining strategy and evolving the Companys infrastructure to support new products, services and benefits;
the Companys ability to build on its leadership in commercial payments, which will depend in part on competition; the willingness and ability of companies to use credit and charge cards for procurement and other business expenditures as well as use the Companys other products and services for financing needs; perceived or actual difficulties and costs related to setting up B2B payment platforms, the Companys ability to offer attractive value propositions and new products to current and potential customers; the Companys ability to enhance and expand its payment, lending and cash flow management solutions, increase customer engagement, and build out a multi-product digital ecosystem to integrate its broad product set, which is dependent on the Companys continued investment in capabilities, features, functionalities, platforms and technologies and the successful integration of the Companys Center acquisition; and the success of the Companys initiatives to support businesses, such as Small Business Saturday and other Shop Small campaigns;
the Companys ability to expand merchant coverage globally and its success, as well as the success of third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors, in signing merchants to accept American Express, which will depend on, among other factors, the value propositions offered to merchants and merchant acquirers for card acceptance, the awareness and willingness of Card Members to use American Express cards at merchants, scaling marketing and expanding programs to increase card usage, identifying and growing acceptance in low- and new-to-plastic industries and businesses as they form, working with commercial buyers and suppliers to establish B2B acceptance, executing on the Companys plans to increase coverage in priority international cities, destinations, countries and industry verticals, and continued network investments, including in capabilities that allow for greater digital integration and modernization of its authorization platform;
the Companys ability to grow internationally, which could be impacted by regulation and business practices, such as those capping interchange or other fees, mandating network access or data localization, favoring local competitors or prohibiting or limiting foreign ownership of certain businesses; perceptions of the Companys brand in international jurisdictions; the Companys inability to successfully replicate aspects of its business model internationally and tailor products and services to make them attractive to local customers; competitors with more scale, local experience and established relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants; the success of the Company and
-4-
its network partners in acquiring Card Members and/or merchants; and geopolitical and economic instability, hostilities and tensions (such as involving China and the U.S.), and impacts to cross-border trade and travel;
a failure in or breach of the Companys operational or security systems, processes or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyberattacks or outages, which could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data, disrupt the Companys operations, reduce the use and acceptance of American Express cards and lead to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, remediation and response costs, and reputational harm;
changes in capital and credit market conditions, including those resulting from recent volatility, which may significantly affect the Companys ability to meet its liquidity needs and expectations regarding capital ratios; the Companys access to capital and funding costs; the valuation of the Companys assets; and the Companys credit ratings or those of its subsidiaries;
legal and regulatory developments, which could affect the profitability of the Companys business activities; limit the Companys ability to pursue business opportunities or conduct business in certain jurisdictions; require changes to business practices or governance, or alter the Companys relationships with Card Members, partners, merchants and other third parties, including affecting its network operations and practices governing merchant acceptance, as well as its ability to continue certain cobrand relationships in the EU; impact card fees and rewards programs; exert further pressure on merchant discount rates and the Companys GNS business, as well as result in an increase in surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices; alter the competitive landscape; subject the Company to heightened regulatory scrutiny and result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight and compliance, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, restitution to Card Members or the imposition of fines or monetary penalties; materially affect capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations or ability to pay dividends; or result in harm to the American Express brand; and
factors beyond the Companys control such as business, economic and geopolitical conditions, consumer and business confidence and spending generally, unemployment rates, market volatility, political developments, further escalations or widening of international tensions, regional hostilities and military conflicts, adverse developments affecting third parties, including other financial institutions, merchants or vendors, as well as severe weather conditions and natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes and wildfires), power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, pandemics, terrorism and other catastrophic events, any of which could significantly affect demand for and spending on American Express cards, credit metrics and reserves, loan and receivable balances, deposit levels and other aspects of the Companys business and results of operations or disrupt its global network systems and ability to process transactions.
A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the Companys other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Card Member loans that have been securitized through the Lending Trust do not possess identical characteristics with those of the total U.S. Consumer or U.S. Small Business Card Member loan portfolios, which include securitized and non-securitized Card Member loans.  The reported credit performance of the Lending Trust may, on a month-to-month basis, be better or worse as a result of, among other things, differences in the mix, vintage and aging of loans, the use of end-of-period principal loan balances to calculate write-off statistics in the Lending Trust compared to the use of average loan balances over the reporting period used in the statistics of the U.S. Consumer and U.S. Small Business Card Member loan portfolios, as well as other mechanics of the calculation for the Lending Trust net write-off rate, which is

), to increase the available share reserve by 7 million shares as described in the Companys Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC
) on February 28, 2025 (the
Proxy Statement
). The amended 2019 Plan previously had been approved, subject to stockholder approval, by the Company's Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
A summary of the 2019 Plan is set forth in our Proxy Statement. That summary and the foregoing description of the 2019 Plan are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the 2019 Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

On April 22, 2025, the Board of Directors of the Company (the

) approved and adopted amendments to the Companys bylaws (as amended, the
Amended and Restated Bylaws
), which became effective the same day. Among other things, the amendments contained in the Amended and Restated Bylaws:
Address the universal proxy rules adopted by the SEC, by clarifying that no person may solicit proxies in support of a director nominee other than the Boards nominees unless such person has, or is part of a group that has, complied with Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
Exchange Act
), including applicable notice and solicitation requirements.
Update and enhance certain procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements in connection with stockholder nominations of directors and submissions of proposals regarding other business at stockholder meetings (other than proposals to be included in the Companys proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or nominations through proxy access).
Require that a stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for exclusive use by the Board.
Revise and align the advance notice windows for nominations and other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder to not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding years annual meeting of stockholders. As a result, to be considered at the Companys 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a stockholders nomination or proposal of other business must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Companys Secretary at the Companys principal executive offices not later than the close of business on January 22, 2026 nor earlier than the close of business on December 23, 2025.
The Amended and Restated Bylaws also incorporate certain technical, clarifying and conforming changes, including to reflect updates to the Delaware General Corporation Law.
The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended and Restated Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

, Gilead Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Gilead), issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended March31, 2025. A copy of the press release is filed as
Exhibit 99.1
to this report.
Gilead has presented certain financial information in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also on a non-GAAP basis. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Gileads GAAP financial statements, because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of Gileads operating results as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.  A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in the tables on pages 9, 10 and 11 of the press release filed as
Exhibit
99.1
to this report.
The information in Item 2.02 and Item 9.01 of this Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

On April29, 2025, Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2025. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated by reference herein.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition, including Exhibit 99, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing made by us under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 2.05 Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On April 29, 2025, Pfizer announced approximately $1.2 billion of additional anticipated savings associated with its ongoing cost realignment program (the Realigning Our Cost Base  Program or the Program) expected to be achieved by the end of 2027, designed to further reduce costs primarily in selling, information and administrative expenses (SI&A) driven in large part by enhanced digital enablement, including automation and artificial intelligence (AI), and simplification of business processes.  Pfizer expects one-time costs to achieve the additional savings to be incurred through 2027 and to total approximately $1.6 billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, digital enablement and implementation. Pfizer announced that it remains on track to deliver net cost savings of approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2025, and, with the additional targeted savings, Pfizer now expects total net cost savings of approximately $5.7 billion from this program through 2027.
(1)
In addition, in connection with Pfizers efforts to simplify the structure and sharpen the focus of its research and development (R&D) organization, in the first quarter of 2025 Pfizer expanded the Program after having identified additional opportunities to drive improvements in productivity and operational efficiencies through enhanced digital enablement, including automation and AI, and simplification of business processes. Savings associated with the simplification of the companys R&D organization are anticipated to be realized by the end of 2026 and are expected to total approximately $500 million and be reinvested in R&D programs. Pfizer expects one-time costs to implement these initiatives to be incurred through 2026 and to total approximately $600 million, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, digital enablement and implementation.
The estimate of costs that Pfizer expects to incur and savings that Pfizer expects to achieve, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ from current expectations. Pfizer may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the Program.

The net cost savings are calculated versus the midpoint of Pfizers 2023 SI&A and R&D expense guidance provided on August 1, 2023.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, Pfizers anticipated operating and financial performance and a cost realignment program (including anticipated costs, timing, savings and potential benefits) that involves substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in business and financial planning, including, without limitation, risks related to Pfizers business and prospects, adverse developments in Pfizers markets, or adverse developments in the U.S. or global capital markets, credit markets, regulatory environment or economies generally; uncertainties regarding the commercial success of Pfizers products or product candidates; uncertainties inherent in research and development; uncertainties regarding the impact, success, associated costs of Pfizers multi-year program to reduce its cost of goods sold and its enterprise-wide cost realignment program; risks and uncertainties related to, restructurings and internal reorganizations, as
well as any other corporate strategic initiatives and growth strategies, and cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, each of which requires upfront costs but may fail to yield anticipated benefits and may result in unexpected costs or organizational disruption; adverse effects on employee morale, retention issues or other unintended consequences; disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners or third-party suppliers; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture or test any of Pfizers products or product candidates; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our manufacturing efforts; the risk that we may not be able to maintain manufacturing capacity or access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand, which would negatively impact our ability to supply our products; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of any of Pfizers products or product candidates, including the authorization or approval of products or therapies developed by other companies; uncertainties regarding the impacts of potential changes in tariffs and trade policies; uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results; and competitive developments.
You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties that affect the business of Pfizer described in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results sections of its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by Pfizer from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available at www.sec.gov and www.pfizer.com.
