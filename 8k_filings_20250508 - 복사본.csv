On May 8, 2025, Coinbase Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Coinbase”), Sentillia B.V., a private limited liability company organized under the laws of the Netherlands (“Deribit”), the Deribit shareholders listed on Exhibit B thereto (the “Deribit Shareholders”) and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the shareholders’ agent (“Shareholders’ Agent”), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement and Share Purchase (as defined below) have been approved by the respective boards of directors or equivalent governing bodies of Coinbase and Deribit.
The Purchase Agreement provides that, on the date of closing of the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the “Closing”), and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Coinbase or its affiliate will acquire, from the Deribit Shareholders, all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Deribit (the “Share Purchase”). As consideration for the Share Purchase, Coinbase will (i) pay the Deribit Shareholders an aggregate of $700 million in cash; and (ii) issue to the Deribit Shareholders an aggregate of 10,997,881 shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 (“Coinbase Stock”), subject to (a) customary adjustments for net working capital, unpaid indebtedness, unpaid transaction expenses and the amount of unrestricted cash held by Deribit, (b) an amount to be held in escrow for 15 months with respect to the indemnification obligations of the Deribit Shareholders as set forth in the Purchase Agreement and (c) amounts to be withheld with respect to a purchase price adjustment escrow and an expense fund for the Shareholders’ Agent.
The obligation of the parties to consummate the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of customary conditions, including: (i) receipt of certain regulatory approvals; (ii) the absence of laws or orders restraining or preventing the consummation of the Share Purchase; (iii) the representations and warranties of Coinbase, Deribit and the Deribit Shareholders being true and correct, subject to the materiality standards contained in the Purchase Agreement, and Coinbase, Deribit and the Deribit Shareholders having complied in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Purchase Agreement; (iv) the absence of any effects that have constituted or resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to constitute or result in, a material adverse effect for Coinbase or Deribit; and (v) the receipt by Coinbase and Deribit of certain closing agreements and certificates. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties given by Coinbase, Deribit and the Deribit Shareholders. Coinbase, Deribit and the Deribit Shareholders have also each made customary covenants in the Purchase Agreement, including covenants by Deribit relating to the conduct of its business prior to the Closing. The Purchase Agreement contains customary termination rights for Coinbase and Deribit, including if the Share Purchase is not completed by November 8, 2025 (subject to extension rights to the extent certain regulatory approvals remain outstanding) (the “Outside Date”). Under the Purchase Agreement, Coinbase will be required to pay a termination fee to Deribit equal to $100 million if the Purchase Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals prior to the Outside Date. The parties have agreed to use their respective reasonable efforts to complete the Share Purchase, including to obtain certain specified regulatory approvals for the transaction.
Coinbase intends to issue the shares of Coinbase Stock at Closing as part of the consideration for the transaction proposed by the Purchase Agreement in reliance upon the exemptions from registration afforded by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Coinbase has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-3 as promptly as practicable following the Closing covering the resale of such shares of Coinbase Stock. In connection with the Share Purchase, certain Deribit Shareholders, who will receive more than 75% of the Coinbase Stock issued in connection with the Share Purchase in the aggregate, have agreed to enter into a lock-up arrangement to place restrictions on the transfer of two-thirds of the shares of Coinbase Stock received by such Deribit Shareholders, with 50% of such shares released from the lock-up 90 days following the Closing and the remaining 50% of such shares released from the lock-up 180 days following the Closing.
The foregoing description of the Share Purchase and the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any factual information about the parties.
The Purchase Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, which were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specified dates. In particular, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in the Purchase Agreement may be subject to limitations agreed by the parties, including having been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made between the parties in connection with the negotiation of the Purchase Agreement, and having been made for purposes of allocating risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. In addition, the parties may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Purchase Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in parties’ public disclosures. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the parties."

Forward-Looking Statement Disclosure
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding Coinbase’s anticipated closing of the Share Purchase. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “plan,” “target,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations, assumptions, and projections based on information available at the time the statements were made. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among others: failure to obtain applicable regulatory approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the transaction or to complete the transaction on anticipated terms and timing; negative effects of the announcement of the transaction; risks that the businesses will not be integrated successfully on a timely basis or at all, or that Coinbase will not realize expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and/or growth, or that such benefits may take longer to realize than expected; the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm business plans and operations; significant transaction and integration costs; the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the
transaction on Coinbase’s, Deribit’s or the combined company’s relationships with partners, customers, employees and regulators; demand for Coinbase’s, Deribit’s, or the combined company’s products and services; market acceptance of Coinbase’s products and services; Coinbase’s ability to expand internationally; the effects of increased competition in Coinbase’s markets; Coinbase’s ability to stay in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; stock price fluctuations; market conditions across the cryptoeconomy, including crypto asset price volatility; and general market, political, and economic conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, inflation, instability in the global banking system, economic downturns, and other global events, including regional wars and conflicts, tariffs and government shutdowns. It is not possible for Coinbase’s management to predict all risks, nor can Coinbase assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements Coinbase may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, Coinbase’s actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from forecasted results are, or will be included, in the filings Coinbase makes with the SEC from time to time, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on February 13, 2025. Except as required by law, Coinbase assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements."

Officers
On May 8, 2025, the Company announced the appointment of Amit Banati as Kenvue’s Chief Financial Officer, which is expected to be effective May 12, 2025 (Mr. Banati’s
start date, the “Effective Date”).
Mr. Banati, age 56, currently serves as Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Kellanova (formerly Kellogg Company), a leading company in global snacking,
international cereal, noodles and frozen foods. He began serving in this role in December 2022. Prior to that position, he was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Kellogg Company from July 2019 to December 2022. Mr. Banati joined
Kellogg Company in March 2012 as President, Asia Pacific, and his responsibilities were expanded to President, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa in July 2018. Before joining Kellogg Company, Mr. Banati served in a variety of finance, general
management and board roles at Kraft Foods, Cadbury Schweppes and Procter & Gamble. Mr. Banati currently serves on the board of directors of Fortune Brands Innovations.
In connection with Mr. Banati’s appointment, Mr. Banati and the Company executed an offer letter on May 5, 2025 (the “Offer Letter”). The Offer Letter provides for a base
salary of $900,000, eligibility for an annual bonus target of 110% of Mr. Banati’s base salary, annual equity award grants with an aggregate target value of $3.2 million, and that Mr. Banati will be an “Eligible Employee” for purposes of the
Executive Severance Pay Plan of Kenvue Inc. and U.S. Affiliated Companies (the “Severance Plan”). Mr. Banati’s 2025 equity grant will be granted at the target value and consist of the same types of awards, with the same vesting terms, as for
Kenvue’s other executive officers. Mr. Banati will be subject to the Company’s standard restrictive covenant agreement, which includes restrictions relating to non-competition, non-solicitation, and protection of confidential information.
The Company agreed to provide Mr. Banati with the following awards: (1) a cash bonus of $2,500,000, paid shortly after the Effective Date; (2) an award of RSUs with a
fair market value of $4,000,000, granted within two months of the Effective Date; (3) a cash bonus of $4,000,000, paid upon the closing of the merger transaction between Mars Inc. and Kellanova (the “Transaction”), if such closing occurs no later
than August 13, 2026 (the “Transaction Condition”); and (4) an award of RSUs with a fair market value of $2,500,000, granted within two months of the satisfaction of the Transaction Condition. The equity awards will vest over a three-year period
following the applicable grant date. The cash-based awards will generally be subject to 100% repayment if Mr. Banati terminates employment prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date and 50% repayment if Mr. Banati terminates employment
prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date.
The Offer Letter further provides that if Mr. Banati’s employment with Kenvue terminates (1) due to death or “disability”, (2) by Mr. Banati for “good reason” or (3) by
the Company other than for “significant  misconduct” (as such terms are defined in the Offer Letter), then: (i) any requirement to repay the cash sign-on awards will no longer apply; (ii) the equity sign-on awards will vest in full upon death or
disability and will otherwise be subject to continued vesting; and (iii) if the Transaction Condition is satisfied after such termination, Mr. Banati will receive any sign-on compensation that is subject to achievement of the Transaction Condition.
The foregoing description of the Offer Letter does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Offer Letter, a copy of which is
attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
There are no family relationships, as defined in Item 401 of Regulation S-K, between Mr. Banati and any of Kenvue’s executive officers or directors or persons nominated
or chosen by Kenvue to become a director or executive officer. There have been no transactions since the beginning of the Company’s last fiscal year, and there are no currently proposed transactions, in which the Company was or is to be a
participant and in which Mr. Banati, or any member of his immediate family, had or will have any interest, that are required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. There is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Banati and any
other person pursuant to which Mr. Banati was appointed as an officer of the Company.
On May 8, 2025, the Company also announced that Paul Ruh, currently Kenvue’s Chief Financial Officer, will cease to serve as Chief Financial Officer on the Effective
Date (the “CFO Transition”). Mr. Ruh will remain with the Company in a strategic advisor role through May 16, 2025, to assist with the transition of his duties. The CFO Transition, with respect to Mr. Ruh, meets the conditions of the separation
without “cause” provisions of the Severance Plan and Mr. Ruh’s long-term incentive awards. Accordingly, subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates and his continuing compliance with his restrictive
covenant obligations, Mr. Ruh will receive the severance payments and benefits payable under the Severance Plan and his long-term incentive awards will be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements."

Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward-looking, including without limitation statements regarding our financial outlook and succession planning. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “toward,” “will,” or “would,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may cause actual results or outcomes to be materially different from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors include the risks described from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the Commission on February 28, 2025. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The Company has based these forward-looking statements primarily on information available to it as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K and its current expectations and projections about future events and trends that it believes may affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. While the Company believes such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. The Company’s statements should not be read to indicate that it has conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks may emerge from time to time. It is not possible for the Company to predict all risks, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements it may make. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation, and does not intend, to update these forward-looking statements."

The information in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, is being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 (the “Section”) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing."

On May 8, 2025, the Company announced plans to implement a holding company reorganization (the “Holding Company Reorganization”), currently planned to become effective by June 1, 2025, by executing a tax-free merger of the Company with and into Rocket Lab Merger Sub, Inc., a newly formed Delaware corporation that is a subsidiary of a newly formed Delaware corporation, Rocket Lab Corporation (“Rocket Lab Corporation”). Upon the effectiveness of the Holding Company Reorganization, Rocket Lab Corporation would become the successor issuer to the Company, a Delaware corporation.
The Company anticipates multiple benefits as a result of the Holding Company Reorganization, including a more efficient structure to accommodate growth through acquisitions and opportunities and better management of risks and liabilities.
Each share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Company Common Stock”) and each share of the Company’s Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per shares (“Company Series A Preferred Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization would automatically be converted into an equivalent corresponding share of Rocket Lab Corporation’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Rocket Lab Corporation Common Stock”) or Rocket Lab Corporation’s Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Rocket Lab Corporation Series A Preferred Stock”), respectively, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock being converted.
Accordingly, upon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, the Company’s stockholders immediately prior to the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization would become stockholders of Rocket Lab Corporation. The stockholders of the Company would not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the conversion of their shares of Company Common Stock in the Holding Company Reorganization.
The Holding Company Reorganization would be conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which provides for the formation of a holding company without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporation. The conversion of stock would occur automatically without any action on the part of existing securityholders. Immediately after the Holding Company Reorganization, stock certificates and book-entries that previously represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock would represent the same number of shares of the corresponding shares of Rocket Lab Corporation Common Stock or Rocket Lab Corporation Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable. Following the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, Rocket Lab Corporation Common Stock would continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market on an uninterrupted basis under the symbol “RKLB” with a new CUSIP number. Immediately after consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, Rocket Lab Corporation would have, on a consolidated basis, the same directors, assets, businesses and operations as the Company had immediately prior to the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization. The directors of Rocket Lab Corporation and their committee memberships and titles would be the same as the directors of the Company immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization. The executive officers and officers of Rocket Lab Corporation would be the same as the executive officers and officers, respectively, of the Company immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization, with the same title, duties and responsibilities.
The Company may determine not to implement the Holding Company Reorganization or the completion of the Holding Company Reorganization could be delayed beyond the currently anticipated timeframe, including for factors beyond the control of the Company."

The Board of Directors of BWX Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) approved a special grant of performance restricted stock units (“PSU”) and non-qualified performance stock options (“NQPSO”) to Rex D. Geveden, President and Chief Executive Officer, on May 7, 2025 with a target value of $5.5 million. This award is intended to further incentivize long-term shareholder value creation and contains aggressive performance hurdles that must be met to generate payouts under the terms of the award. The PSU component of the award, with a grant date fair value of $2.2 million, will cliff vest on December 31, 2027, subject to the achievement of cumulative revenue (50%) and EBITDA margin expansion (50%) targets for the performance period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027 (the “First Performance Period”). The number of PSUs earned will be based on the level of performance achieved during the First Performance Period with potential payouts ranging from 0% to 150% on each metric. The terms of the PSU award agreement are largely consistent with the Company’s prior PSU award agreements with the exclusion of retirement-related vesting provisions that would otherwise be applicable to Mr. Geveden. The NQPSO component of the award, with a grant date fair value of $3.3 million, will cliff vest on December 31, 2027, subject to the achievement of total shareholder return relative to the S&P Aerospace and Defense Select Index for the performance period May 7, 2025 through December 31, 2027 (the “Second Performance Period”). The number of NQPSOs earned will be based on the level of performance achieved during the Second Performance Period with potential payouts ranging from 0% to 150%. The forms of NQPSO and PSU award agreements are included as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on May 5, 2025 and incorporated herein by reference."

On May 8, 2025, MGM Resorts International, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into an employment agreement with William Hornbuckle, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the “Employment Agreement”), replacing Mr. Hornbuckle’s existing agreement, which was dated as of September 1, 2022 and had a termination date of August 31, 2026, given the importance of ensuring that Mr. Hornbuckle continue to lead the Company for the long term. The Employment Agreement provides for a term until December 31, 2028 with a minimum base salary remaining at $2,000,000 per year.
The Employment Agreement provides for an annual target bonus equal to 250% of Mr. Hornbuckle’s base salary; provided that, any amounts paid in excess of 150% of Mr. Hornbuckle’s target bonus will be paid in fully vested deferred restricted stock units payable in 33% installments over the 3-year period following the grant date (and subject to acceleration in the event Mr. Hornbuckle’s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason) (“DRSUs”).
The Employment Agreement also provides that, subject to the discretion of the Human Capital and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board, Mr. Hornbuckle will be eligible for annual equity grants in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 with an expected value of $10,000,000 each year, consistent with his prior agreement. Annual equity awards are expected to be provided 50% in the form of performance share units and 50% in the form of restricted stock units. The Employment Agreement further provides Mr. Hornbuckle with certain other benefits and perquisites, which are discussed in detail in the Agreement.
The Employment Agreement also provides for a special one-time cash bonus of $8,000,000 (less applicable tax withholdings) (the “Signing Bonus”). The Signing Bonus is subject to Mr. Hornbuckle’s continued employment with the Company through the end of the term. If Mr. Hornbuckle is terminated for cause or voluntarily resigns (other than for good cause) then Mr. Hornbuckle will reimburse the Company a pro-rata amount based on days employed after the effective date of the Employment Agreement compared to days from the effective date through December 31, 2028.
In the event of a termination of Mr. Hornbuckle’s employment as the result of his death or a termination by the Company due to disability, the Company will pay Mr. Hornbuckle one year of salary payable at regular payroll intervals (less any payments received from an employer-paid short term disability policy). In the event of death or disability, Mr. Hornbuckle will not be required to reimburse the Company for a pro-rata portion of the Retention Bonus.
The Employment Agreement further provides that the at the end of the term, the Company will offer Mr. Hornbuckle a new employment agreement as a Special Advisor and member of the Board of the Japan Integrated Resort project for a monthly salary of $25,000 through the opening of the project. The Company also agreed to consider in good faith a success bonus, payable in cash, upon the opening of the Japan Integrated Resort project.
In the event of a termination by the Company for no cause or by Mr. Hornbuckle for good cause prior to the end of the term of the Hornbuckle Employment Agreement or for the 12-month period thereafter, Mr. Hornbuckle will receive (i) one and a half times (A) his annual base salary as in effect on May 8, 2025 and (B) his target bonus, payable in 12 monthly installments and (ii) a lump sum payment equal to the cost of 24 months of COBRA coverage payable in 12 monthly installments. In the event of such termination, Mr. Hornbuckle will not be required to reimburse the Company for a pro-rata portion of the Retention Bonus. Any such severance payments will be subject to applicable taxes and Mr. Hornbuckle’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims.
The Employment Agreement also contains a non-compete covenant generally prohibiting Mr. Hornbuckle from providing services to a competitor or soliciting employees or business contacts for 12 months following his termination of employment or for 12 months following the term of the Employment Agreement. In addition, the Employment Agreement mandates that Mr. Hornbuckle’s confidentiality obligations continue even after his termination of employment.

As
previously disclosed
, on June 16, 2023, Black Hills Corporation, a South Dakota corporation (the “Company”),
entered into an Equity Distribution Sales Agreement (the “Existing Sales Agreement”), by and among (a) the Company,
(b) each of Bank of Montreal, Bank of America, N.A., MUFG Securities EMEA plc, Mizuho Markets Americas LLC, and Royal Bank of Canada
(each a “Forward Purchaser” and together, the “Forward Purchasers”), (c) each of BMO Capital
Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., MUFG Securities Americas Inc., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, and RBC Capital Markets, LLC (each
in its capacity as sales agent and/or principal, an “Agent” and together, the “Agents”), and (d) each
of BMO Capital Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., MUFG Securities Americas Inc., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, and RBC Capital Markets,
LLC (each in its capacity as agent for its affiliated Forward Purchaser (each, a “Forward Seller” and together, the“Forward Sellers”), with respect to the offering and sale from time to time through the Agents of shares of the Company’s
common stock, par value $1.00, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $400,000,000 (the “Shares”), through
an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) utilizing the Company’s shelf Registration
Statement on Form S-3 originally filed on June 16, 2023 (Registration No.

33-272739)
(the “Shelf”).
On May 8, 2025, the Company entered into a
First Amendment to Equity Distribution Sales Agreement (the “First Amendment”), dated May 8, 2025, by and among the
Company, the Forward Purchasers, the Agents and the Forward Sellers (the Existing Sales Agreement as amended by the First Amendment, the“Sales Agreement”). The First Amendment, among other things provides for the continuation of the ATM Program using
the Shelf and resets the size of the ATM Program to an aggregate gross sale price of up to $400,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the
First Amendment aggregate gross sales price limitation supersedes and replaces the aggregate gross sales price limitation provided in
the Existing Sales Agreement. The offering of the Shares will be made pursuant to the Shelf, a base prospectus dated June 16, 2023,
and Prospectus Supplement dated May 8, 2025. Except as modified by the First Amendment, the Sales Agreement and the form of master
forward confirmation included therein remain in full force and effect.
In
the ordinary course of business, certain of the parties to the Sales Agreement or their respective affiliates have provided and may in
the future provide commercial, financial advisory or investment banking services for the Company and its subsidiaries for which they have
received or will receive customary compensation. For example, affiliates of certain of the parties to the Sales Agreement
are lenders
and/or agents under certain of our existing credit facilities. To the extent that we use the net proceeds from the offering to repay amounts
we have borrowed, may borrow or re-borrow in the future under such facilities, those lenders will receive their pro rata portion of the
proceeds from this offering we use to pay any such amounts.
The summary of the First
Amendment in this report does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the First Amendment, which
is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto.
In connection with the
issuance and sale of the Shares, the Company is also filing a legal opinion regarding the validity of the Shares as Exhibit 5.1 for
the purpose of incorporating the opinion into the Registration Statement."

On May 8, 2025, Haemonetics Corporation (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 29, 2025. A copy of the press release is furnished with this report as Exhibit 99.1.
The foregoing information, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing."

In May 2025, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new market and regional alignment initiative and delegated authority to the Company’s management to determine the details of the specific actions that will comprise the initiative. This new strategic initiative is designed to improve operational performance and reduce costs by directing the Company’s resources toward the markets and geographies that offer the greatest growth and portfolio advancement opportunities. We expect to incur aggregate restructuring and restructuring-related charges of approximately $20 million associated with this initiative, approximately half of which we expect will consist of severance and other employee costs and the remainder of which will consist of other exit costs, primarily related to third party arrangements. These charges, substantially all of which will result in cash outlays, will be incurred as the specific actions required to execute on the initiative are identified and approved and are expected to continue through the end of fiscal 2027. We expect savings from this initiative of approximately $30 million on an annualized basis once the initiative is completed.
The amounts and timing of estimated costs and savings are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements about the market and regional alignment initiative. These statements are based on our current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which we can give no firm assurance. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made. As it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of our actual future financial condition or results.
These forward-looking statements, like any forward-looking statements, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Factors that may influence or contribute to the inaccuracy of the forward-looking statements or cause actual results to differ materially from expected or desired results may include, without limitation, whether the Company will be able to implement the market and regional alignment initiative as planned, whether the expected amount of the costs associated with the market and regional alignment initiative will exceed the Company’s forecasts, and whether the Company will be able to realize the full amount of estimated savings from the market and regional alignment initiative. Investors should consult the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including the Company’s reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K) for information about additional risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements."

On May 8, 2025, Diodes Incorporated (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing its first quarter ended March 31, 2025 financial results. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
In the press release, the Company utilizes financial measures and terms not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) in order to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing the Company’s operating results in a manner that enables investors to more thoroughly evaluate its current performance as compared to past performance. The Company also believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors with a more informed baseline for modeling the Company’s future financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for the same purpose. The Company believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses in analyzing results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results and may differ from similar measures used by other companies. See Exhibit 99.1 for a description and reconciliation with GAAP of the non-GAAP measures used.
The information furnished in this Item 2.02, including the exhibit incorporated by reference, will not be treated as “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. This information will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or into another filing under the Exchange Act, unless that filing expressly refers to specific information in this Report."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Overview
This press release and the accompanying schedules include non-generally accepted accounting principle (non-GAAP) financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and total Available Cash before Reserves. In this press release, we also present total Segment Margin as if it were a non-GAAP measure. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because such measures may include or exclude other specified items. The accompanying schedules provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance or (ii) as being singularly important in any particular context; they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information. Our Available Cash before Reserves, Adjusted EBITDA and total Segment Margin measures are just three of the relevant data points considered from time to time.
When evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions (including making discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of directors and management team have access to a wide range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational information; various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance; liquidity and similar measures; income; cash flow expectations for us; and certain information regarding some of our peers.  Additionally, our board of directors and management team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time to time.  We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external user.
Available Cash before Reserves
Purposes, Uses and Definition
Available Cash before Reserves, often referred to by others as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:
(1)
the financial performance of our assets;
(2)
our operating performance;
(3)
the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;
(4)
the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and
(5)
our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our preferred and common units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.
We define Available Cash before Reserves (“Available Cash before Reserves”) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for certain items, the most significant of which in the relevant reporting periods have been the sum of maintenance capital utilized, interest expense, net, cash tax expense and cash distributions paid to our Class A Convertible Preferred unitholders.
Disclosure Format Relating to Maintenance Capital
We use a modified format relating to maintenance capital requirements because our maintenance capital expenditures vary materially in nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount from time to time.  We believe that, without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the context of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our modified disclosure format provides those users with information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available Cash before Reserves). Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period.
Maintenance Capital Requirements
Maintenance Capital Expenditures
Maintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances.
Prior to 2014, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures were (a) related to our pipeline assets and similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those historical expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had very little (if any) discretion as to whether or when we incurred them. We had to incur them in order to continue to operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices. If we had not made those expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines, which would not have been economically feasible.
An example of a non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or economically in the absence of such replacement.
Beginning with 2014, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time will be (a) related to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels, trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c) potentially material in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those expenditures will be discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we incur them.  We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner. If we chose not to make those expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically, although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses, including maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses.
In summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are experiencing changes in the nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was required historically. Management’s increasing ability to determine if and when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures. We believe it would be inappropriate to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe are similar in nature in this context to certain other discretionary expenditures, such as growth capital expenditures, distributions/dividends and equity buybacks. Unfortunately, not all maintenance capital expenditures are clearly discretionary or non-discretionary in nature. Therefore, we developed a measure, maintenance capital utilized, that we believe is more useful in the determination of Available Cash before Reserves.
Maintenance Capital Utilized
We believe our maintenance capital utilized measure is the most useful quarterly maintenance capital requirements measure to use to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure. We define our maintenance capital utilized measure as that portion of the amount of previously incurred maintenance capital expenditures that we utilize during the relevant quarter, which would be equal to the sum of the maintenance capital expenditures we have incurred for each project/component in prior quarters allocated ratably over the useful lives of those projects/components.
Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period. Because we did not use our maintenance capital utilized measure before 2014, our maintenance capital utilized calculations will reflect the utilization of solely those maintenance capital expenditures incurred since December 31, 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA
Purposes, Uses and Definition
Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:
(1)
the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structures or historical cost basis;
(2)
our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing and capital structure;
(3)
the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;
(4)
the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and
(5)
our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our preferred and common units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.
We define Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as Net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (including impairment, write-offs, accretion and similar items) after eliminating other non-cash revenues, expenses, gains, losses and charges (including any loss on asset dispositions), plus or minus certain other select items that we view as not indicative of our core operating results (collectively, “Select Items”).  Although we do not necessarily consider all of our Select Items to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, we believe that an understanding of these Select Items is important to the evaluation of our core operating results. The most significant Select Items in the relevant reporting periods are set forth in this press release."

On May 8, 2025 (the “Execution Date”), BKV dCarbon Ventures, LLC (“dCarbon Ventures”), a wholly owned subsidiary of BKV Corporation (“BKV” or the “Company”), together with C Squared Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Investor” and, together with dCarbon Ventures, the “JV Members”) and, for the limited purposes specified therein, BKV, entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement of BKV dCarbon Project, LLC (the “BKV-CIP JV Agreement”) forming BKV dCarbon Project, LLC (the “BKV-CIP JV” or “JV”) for the purpose of developing carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (“CCUS”) projects. On the Execution Date and contemporaneously with their entry into the BKV-CIP JV Agreement, the JV Members entered into ancillary agreements including, but not limited to, a master services agreement between BKV and the JV (the “Master Services Agreement”), each of which are further described below.
Joint Venture Agreement
Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment
.  Pursuant to the BKV-CIP JV Agreement, (i) dCarbon Ventures will contribute certain CCUS projects, related assets and/or cash, in exchange for Class A Units (the “Class A Units”) representing no less than a 51% interest in the BKV-CIP JV and (ii) subject to the Condition Precedent to Funding (as described below), Investor will contribute up to $500 million in cash to the BKV-CIP JV over the course of five years (the “Investor Commitment”) as and when capital is called pursuant to the terms of the BKV-CIP JV Agreement in exchange for Class B Units (the “Class B Units”) representing no more than a 49% interest in the JV. The Investor Commitment may be increased to $1 billion upon the mutual written agreement of the JV Members. As of the Execution Date, dCarbon Ventures has contributed to the BKV-CIP JV its ownership of its Barnett Zero and Eagle Ford CCUS projects. Subject to the limitations contained in the BKV-CIP JV Agreement, the JV will be funded in cash (i) initially by Investor until Investor has contributed cash equal to 49% of the total value contributed by the JV Members to the JV, (ii) next 50% by dCarbon Ventures and 50% by Investor until specified minimum return targets are achieved by Investor and (iii) thereafter, 51% by dCarbon Ventures and 49% by Investor. The Investor may from time to time present additional CCUS projects to the JV. If dCarbon Ventures and the Investor mutually agree such additional CCUS projects will be contributed to the JV.
Distributions
.  Other than quarterly tax distributions and distributions in respect of a deemed liquidation event (as defined in the BKV-CIP JV Agreement), distributions will be made in accordance with a waterfall until specified minimum return targets are achieved by Investor.
Exclusivity
.  BKV has agreed that it and its affiliates will develop CCUS projects exclusively through the BKV-CIP JV except that any CCUS projects that are rejected by Investor for development by the BKV-CIP JV may be developed solely through dCarbon Ventures outside of the JV. This exclusivity commitment will terminate if Investor rejects 40% or more of the qualified CCUS projects presented to the JV in any sequential 15-month period from the Execution Date.
Governance
:  The BKV-CIP JV is governed by a board of managers (the “BKV-CIP Board”) consisting of five members, three of whom are designated by dCarbon Ventures and two of whom are designated by Investor. Most operational decisions and activities of the BKV-CIP JV are reserved for approval by a majority of the members of the BKV-CIP Board, but Investor has customary minority investor rights, including veto rights with respect to, among other things, the amount and timing of distributions to the JV Members, the JV’s annual budget, any sale or IPO of the JV, any change in senior management of the JV, and other significant and related party transactions of the JV.
Environmental Attributes
:  The JV will monetize all environmental attributes, including pursuant to a first right of BKV or its affiliates to purchase such environmental attributes at fair market value.
Investor Equity Swap Option
.  Following the third anniversary of the Execution Date, Investor may elect to exchange its Class B Units for a 49% common equity interest in dCarbon Ventures, subject to adjustment to the extent that dCarbon Ventures owns assets in excess of its interests in the JV (the “Equity Swap Option”). In the event that Investor exercises the Equity Swap Option, BKV and the JV Members would enter into definitive agreements providing that (x) BKV would pursue its CCUS business exclusively through dCarbon Ventures, (y) dCarbon Ventures would be governed by board of managers comprised in the same manner as the BKV-CIP Board, and (z) Investor would be entitled to certain customary registration rights and minority investor rights, including preemptive rights and veto rights.
Transfer Restrictions; Right of First Offer; Co-Sale Right
.  Each JV Member is subject to restrictions on its ability to transfer its units in the BKV-CIP JV other than to affiliates. In addition, except with respect to specified exceptions, each JV Member has a right of first offer to purchase the other Member’s units in connection with any proposed transfer. Investor has a co-sale right in connection with a proposed transfer of Class A Units by dCarbon Ventures.
Investor Drag Right
.  Subject to the right of first offer, unless Investor receives cash distributions that meet its minimum return targets by the fifth anniversary of the Execution Date, Investor will have the right to initiate a sale of the BKV-CIP JV, which would be conducted in a manner that maximizes the value of the JV.
Investor Redemption Right
.  Upon delivery of written notice to BKV during the 30-day period immediately before the second anniversary of the Execution Date, Investor has a one-time right to sell its Class B Units to the Company for cash in an amount equal to 1.65x all capital contributed to the JV by Investor as of such date, less prior distributions made to Investor. BKV would own 100% of the JV equity interests and related cash flow if this right is exercised.
Minimum Asset Coverage Ratio.
The BKV-CIP JV is required to maintain an asset coverage ratio of at least 2.0:1.0. If the JV falls below
such threshold, Investor may require dCarbon Ventures to provide collateral sufficient to correct the deficiency, which obligation is guaranteed by the Company.
Additional Agreements
45Q Letter Agreement
.  On the Execution Date, BKV entered into the 45Q Letter Agreement with Investor, dCarbon Ventures and the JV, which prohibits dCarbon Ventures from requiring capital contributions from Investor until after June 1, 2025 (the “Condition Precedent to Funding”) and provides the Members with a right to terminate the BKV-CIP JV Agreement and all related agreements and unwind the JV and related contributions if, prior to June 1, 2025, there occurs (i) a material change in legislation that negatively and materially impacts the availability of Section 45Q tax credits, or (ii) a submission to the United States Committee on the Budget of the United States House or Representatives or the United States Senate by any other committee that would, if enacted or adopted, be reasonably likely to negatively and materially impact the availability of Section 45Q tax credits.
Master Services Agreement
.  On the Execution Date, BKV entered into the Master Services Agreement with the BKV-CIP JV pursuant to which BKV and dCarbon Ventures agreed to provide certain administrative, technical, operational and other services as required by the JV in consideration for an annual fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses.

On April 10, 2025, ANI Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (“ANI” or the “Company”) filed a definitive proxy statement (the “Annual Meeting Proxy Statement”)
for the solicitation of proxies in connection with the 2025 annual meeting of shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) to consider
and vote on, among other proposals, the approval of the Company’s Amended and Restated 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (“Proposal
5”).
The
Company has determined to supplement and clarify information provided in Proposal 5 of the Annual Meeting Proxy Statement as set forth
below (the “Proxy Supplement”). The
first table located under the sub-heading “Purpose of Share Reserve Increase”has been updated to
include non-shareholder approved inducement grants
as
of the record date
.
There is no change to the location, the record
date, or any of the other proposals to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders who have previously submitted their proxies or
otherwise voted and who do not want to change their vote need not take any action.
AMENDMENT AND SUPPLEMENT TO THE 2025 ANNUAL
PROXY STATEMENT
The following disclosures in this Current Report
on Form 8-K supplement, and should be read in conjunction with, the disclosures contained in the Company’s definitive proxy statement
(the “Annual Proxy Statement”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 10, 2025,
which in turn should be read in its entirety. To the extent the information set forth herein differs from or updates information contained
in the Annual Proxy Statement, the information set forth herein shall supersede or supplement the information in the Annual Proxy Statement.
All other information in the Annual Proxy Statement remains unchanged.
As provided in the Annual Proxy Statement, the
Company is seeking stockholder approval of, among other things, the approval of the Company’s Amended and Restated 2022 Stock Incentive
Plan (“Proposal 5”). The purpose of the supplemental disclosure is to clarify in Proposal 5 that the first table located under
the sub-heading “Purpose of Share Reserve Increase” includes non-shareholder approved inducement grants.
Terms used herein, unless otherwise defined,
have the meanings set forth in the Annual Proxy Statement.
Purpose of Share Reserve Increase
In 2024, the Stock Plan was amended and restated
to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the Stock Plan. As of March 24, 2025, a total of 1,177,800
shares of our common stock remained available for future grants under the Stock Plan. We believe that the current share reserve amount
is insufficient to meet our future needs with respect to attracting, motivating and retaining key executives and employees in a competitive
market for talent. We consider the Stock Plan to be a vital element of our employee compensation program and believe that the continued
ability to grant stock awards at competitive levels is in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders. In recent years, our
compensation structure and strategy has included issuance of grants and share usage to align with market standards.
The table below shows the stock awards that were
outstanding under the shareholder-approved Stock Plan and non-shareholder-approved inducement grants as of March 24, 2025. As of
March 24, 2025, the closing sale price of a share of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market was $65.98.

Retirements of Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
On May 5, 2025, Jean Bua informed the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company of her intention to step down as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective May 31, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), as she transitions toward retirement. The Company has entered into a transition agreement (the “Bua Transition Agreement”) with Ms. Bua, pursuant to which Ms. Bua will continue as an employee of the Company in the capacity of Senior Advisor through June 30, 2026, subject to her earlier termination or resignation (the “Bua Separation Date”). She will continue to receive her existing base compensation and benefits through the Bua Separation Date.  In addition, Ms. Bua will remain eligible to receive her annual incentive bonus for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, but will not be entitled to receive an annual incentive bonus for any other year.  Through the Bua Separation Date, Ms. Bua will also be eligible to vest, in accordance with their terms, in any outstanding awards under the Company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2019 Plan”) of (i) time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), subject to her continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting dates, and (ii) performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”), subject to achievement of the applicable performance goals over the relevant performance periods, if and as certified by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”), and subject to her continued service with the Company through the dates on which the Compensation Committee certifies achievement of the performance goals.  In the event that, prior to the Bua Separation Date, Ms. Bua’s employment is terminated without Cause (as defined in the 2019 Plan) following a Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Plan), Ms. Bua will be entitled to (i) continued payment of base salary through June 30, 2026, less applicable withholdings and deductions, and (ii) continued eligibility for vesting of PSUs through June 30, 2026 (and payment thereunder to the extent the Compensation Committee certifies performance achievement on or before such date).  After the Bua Separation Date, it is expected that Ms. Bua will remain a non-employee advisor to the Company with the same duties and responsibilities as set forth in the Bua Transition Agreement and will not receive further compensation other than continued vesting of her RSUs in accordance with their terms. Such non-employee advisory period will end when all her outstanding RSUs are fully vested.  In the event that there is a Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Plan) while Ms. Bua is serving as an employee or non-employee advisor of the Company, all of her unvested RSUs, to the extent not otherwise accelerated under the terms of the 2019 Plan, will automatically vest in full simultaneously with such Change in Control.  Ms. Bua’s Amended and Restated Severance Agreement was terminated upon entering into the Bua Transition Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Bua Transition Agreement contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of such document, a copy of
which will be filed as exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.
Also on May 5, 2025, Michael Szabados informed the Board of his intention to step down as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective as of the Effective Date, as he transitions toward retirement. The Company has entered into a transition agreement (the “Szabados Transition Agreement”) with Mr. Szabados, pursuant to which Mr. Szabados will continue as a full-time employee of the Company in the capacity of Senior Advisor through June 30, 2026, subject to his earlier termination or resignation (the “Szabados Employment Separation Date”). He will continue to receive his existing base compensation and benefits through the Szabados Employment Separation Date.  In addition, Mr. Szabados will remain eligible to receive his annual incentive bonus for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, but will not be entitled to receive an annual incentive bonus for any other year.  Through the Szabados Employment Separation Date and as long as he continues to serve on the Board, Mr. Szabados will have the same duties and responsibilities as forth in the Szabados Transition Agreement and Mr. Szabados will also be eligible to vest, in accordance with their terms, in any outstanding awards under the 2019 Plan of time-based RSUs, subject to his continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting dates.  Through the Szabados Employment Separation Date (but not during any periods thereafter including any service on the Board), Mr. Szabados will also be eligible to vest, in accordance with their terms, in any outstanding awards under the 2019 Plan of PSUs, subject to achievement of the applicable performance goals over the relevant performance periods, if and as certified by the Compensation Committee, and subject to his continued employment with the Company through the dates on which the Compensation Committee certifies achievement of the performance goals. In the event that prior to the Szabados Employment Separation Date, Mr. Szabados’ employment is terminated without Cause (as defined in the 2019 Plan) following a Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Plan), Mr. Szabados will be entitled to (i) continued payment of base salary through June 30, 2026, less applicable withholdings and deductions, and (ii) continued eligibility for vesting of PSUs through June 30, 2026 (and payment thereunder to the extent the Compensation Committee certifies performance achievement on or before such date).

Following the Effective Date, Mr. Szabados will continue to serve as a Class III member and Vice Chairman of the Board. However, Mr. Szabados will not be eligible to receive compensation under the Company’s non-employee director compensation policy until after the conclusion of his full-time employment as a Senior Advisor with the Company and will not receive equity awards under the non-employee director compensation policy until all RSUs granted prior to the Szabados Employment Separation Date have fully vested.
The foregoing description of the Szabados Transition Agreement contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of such document, a copy of which will be filed as exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.

In such event, such executive officer will receive 12 months of his then-
current salary, and if such termination occurs after a change of control, such executive officer will also receive a prorated amount of his annual incentive bonus target, based on the months elapsed in such year that in any event will not be less than 50% of his annual incentive bonus target, and accelerated vesting of any outstanding unvested equity awards under the 2019 Plan, or any successors thereto, that would have vested or become exercisable within one year of such termination.

The following information, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
On May 8, 2025, the Partnership issued a press release (the “Press Release”) describing its Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Financial Results.  A copy of the Press Release has been furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.
Within the Press Release, we reference net income before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Additionally, we discuss EBITDA excluding the unrealized net gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for derivative instruments and certain other items (“Adjusted EBITDA”).  Our calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented in the Press Release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.
We provide these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they provide the investment community with supplemental measures of operating performance.  In addition, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and industry analysts to evaluate our operating results.
We also reference gross margins, computed as revenues less cost of products sold as those amounts are reported on the consolidated financial statements.  Since cost of products sold does not include depreciation and amortization expense, the gross margin we reference is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Given the nature of our business, the level of profitability in the retail propane, fuel oil, and natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost.  Therefore, we discuss gross margins in order to provide investors and industry analysts with useful information to facilitate their understanding of the impact of the commodity prices on profitability."

On May 8, 2025, the Company posted an investor presentation to its website at https://investors.sproutsocial.com (the“Investor Presentation”). A copy of the Investor Presentation is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The Company expects to use the Investor Presentation, in whole or in part, and possibly with modifications, in connection with presentations to investors, analysts and others.
The information contained in the Investor Presentation is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and other public announcements that the Company may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time. The Investor Presentation speaks only as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in the Investor Presentation, although it may do so from time to time. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure. In addition, the exhibit furnished herewith contains statements intended as “forward-looking statements” that are subject to the cautionary statements about forward-looking statements set forth in such exhibit. By furnishing the information contained in the Investor Presentation, the Company makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in the Investor Presentation that is required to be disclosed solely by reason of Regulation FD.
This Current Report on Form 8-K and its contents (including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2) are furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the“Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the“Securities Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are based on management’s current opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results. These forward-looking statements are only predictions, not historical fact, and involve certain risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions. Actual results, levels of activity, performance, achievements and events could differ materially from those stated, anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements. While the Company believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results. There are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made herein including the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on February 25, 2025, as supplemented by the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 to be filed with the SEC, as well as other factors described from time to time in the Company's other filings with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

On May 8, 2025, the Company entered into a sales agreement (“Sales Agreement”) with TD Securities (USA) LLC (“TD Cowen”) to sell shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), having an aggregate offering price of up to $119.0 million, from time to time, through an “at the market offering” program under which TD Cowen will act as sales agent.
Immediately prior to entering into the Sales Agreement, the Company terminated its sales agreement, dated August 4, 2022, between the Company and TD Cowen (as successor to Cowen and Company, LLC) (the “Prior Sales Agreement”). As of the termination of the Prior Sales Agreement, the Company had sold an aggregate of approximately 4.9 million shares of Common Stock under the Prior Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $30.6 million, resulting in an unsold aggregate offering price of approximately $119.4 million. Following the termination of the Prior Sales Agreement, the Company may not offer or sell any additional shares of Common Stock under the Prior Sales Agreement or the related prospectus, dated May 1, 2023.
Under the Sales Agreement, the Company will set the parameters for the sale of shares of Common Stock, including the number or dollar amount of shares to be issued, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, any limitation on the number or dollar amount of shares that may be sold in any one trading day, and any minimum price below which sales may not be made. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, TD Cowen may sell the shares in negotiated transactions, including block trades or block sales, or by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including without limitation sales made through the Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other trading market for the Common Stock, or by any method permitted by law. TD Cowen has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts in conducting such sales activities consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations, and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. As specified in the Sales Agreement, the Sales Agreement may be terminated by the Company upon written notice to TD Cowen for any reason or by TD Cowen upon written notice to the Company for any reason or at any time under certain circumstances, including in the event of a material adverse change in the Company, subject to the terms of the Sales Agreement.
The Sales Agreement provides that TD Cowen will be entitled to compensation for its services of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sales of shares of Common Stock through TD Cowen under the Sales Agreement. The Company has no obligation to sell any shares under the Sales Agreement, and may at any time suspend sales of shares under the Sales Agreement. The Sales Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and agreements by the Company, indemnification obligations of the Company and TD Cowen, other obligations of the parties, and termination provisions.
On May 8, 2025, the Company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a prospectus supplement (“Prospectus Supplement”) under the Company’s effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-277584) (as amended, “Registration Statement”) in connection with the offer and sale of shares of its Common Stock under the Sales Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Sales Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (“Current Report”) and incorporated herein by reference.
A copy of the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. relating to the validity of the shares of Common Stock to be sold under the Sales Agreement is filed as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report and is hereby incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.
This Current Report does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the shares of Common Stock discussed herein, nor shall there be any sale of such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction."

Forward-Looking Statements
This Report includes statements that express our management’s opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, “forward-looking statements”. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “seeks,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will” or “should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Report, including, but not limited to, statements relating to the anticipated benefits of our rebranding, our strategic alliances with third parties, our recent executive hires and elected directors, and our debt refinancing; our 2025 outlook and guidance; and the long-term prospects of the Company. Such forward-looking statements reflect management’s expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, operational and financial performance and business prospects and opportunities. Such forward-looking statements are based on available current market information and management’s expectations, beliefs and forecasts concerning future events impacting the business. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that these forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. These factors include: loss of our clients, particularly our largest clients; the ability to achieve the goals of our strategic plans and recognize the anticipated strategic, operational, growth and efficiency benefits when expected; our ability to enter new lines of business and broaden the scope of our services; the loss of key members of our management team or inability to maintain sufficient qualified personnel; our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain a large number of skilled employees, and adapt to the effects of inflationary pressure on wages; trends in the U.S. healthcare system, including recent trends of unknown duration of reduced healthcare utilization and increased patient financial responsibility for services; effects of competition;
effects of pricing pressure; the inability of our clients to pay for our services; changes in our industry and in industry standards and technology; adverse outcomes related to litigation or governmental proceedings; interruptions or security breaches of our information technology systems and other cybersecurity attacks; our ability to maintain the licenses or right of use for the software we use; our ability to protect proprietary information, processes and applications; our inability to expand our network infrastructure; inability to preserve or increase our existing market share or the size of our preferred provider organization networks; decreases in discounts from providers; pressure to limit access to preferred provider networks; changes in our regulatory environment, including healthcare law and regulations; the expansion of privacy and security laws; heightened enforcement activity by government agencies; our ability to obtain additional financing; our ability to pay interest and principal on our notes and other indebtedness; lowering or withdrawal of our credit ratings; changes in accounting principles or the incurrence of impairment charges; the possibility that we may be adversely affected by other political, economic, business, and/or competitive factors; other factors disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings; and other factors beyond our control.
The forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and potential effects on our business. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting our business will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those under “Risk Factors” therein, and other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by us. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws."

The Amendment provides for, among other things, (i) the establishment of a delayed draw term loan (the “Term Loan”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75,000,000 that may be drawn prior to February 28, 2026 for the sole purpose of paying  amounts outstanding under the 0.75% convertible senior notes due February 1, 2026 and customary fees and expenses in connection therewith, (ii) a reduction in the aggregate principal amount available under the existing revolving line of credit (the “Revolving Line”) to $25,000,000, (iii) an adjustment of the financial covenants set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, (iv) an extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Line to May 1, 2030, and (v) an adjustment to the interest rate margins applicable to advances. The Term Loan and the Revolving Line both mature on May 1, 2030. Commencing on April 1, 2026, the Borrower must make amortization payments on any advances under the Term Loan at the percentages set forth in the Amendment.
Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to (a) term SOFR plus a specified margin or (b) WSJ prime plus a specified margin, in each case which will be adjusted based on the Company’s net leverage ratio at the time of borrowing. Borrower must also pay the Bank (i) a commitment fee of $125,000 and (ii) an “Unused Revolving Line Facility Fee” of 0.25% per annum of the average unused portion of the Revolving Line.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, and negative and affirmative covenants customary for transactions of this type. These include covenants limiting the ability of Borrower, and any of their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, to, among other things, (i) incur indebtedness, (ii) incur liens on their assets, (iii) enter into any merger or consolidation with, or acquire all or substantially all of the equity or property of, another person, (iv) dispose of any of their business or property, (v) make or permit any payment on subordinated debt, or (vi) pay any dividend, make any other distribution, or redeem any equity.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default and also provides that an event of default includes any default resulting in a right by third parties to accelerate maturity of indebtedness in excess of $500,000. If any event of default occurs and is not cured within applicable grace periods set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement or waived, all loans and other obligations could become due and immediately payable and the facility could be terminated. In addition, Borrower may be required to deposit cash with the Bank in an amount equal to 105% of any undrawn letters of credit denominated in U.S. Dollars or 115% of any undrawn letters of credit denominated in a foreign currency.
A copy of the Amendment is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The above description of the Amendment and Amended Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit."

The Company's proposed repurchases may be made from time to time through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on the market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The actual timing, number, and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the market price of the Company’s common shares, general market and economic conditions, and compliance with Rule 10b-18 and/or Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
The Board will review the Share Repurchase Plan periodically and may authorize adjustment of its terms and size or suspend or discontinue the plan. The Company expects to fund the repurchases under this plan with its existing cash balance.

On May 8, 2025, OPAL Fuels Inc. (the ""Company"")  issued a press release regarding its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
The information disclosed under this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, is being ""furnished"" and shall not be deemed ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of such section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. By filing this Current Report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, the Company makes no statement or admission as to the materiality of any information in this Item 2.02 or the exhibit attached hereto.
This Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward looking statements are based on current expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. Further, the forward-looking statements are subject to the limitations listed in Exhibit 99.1 and in the other SEC reports of the Company, including that actual events or results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
Additionally, to supplement the Company’s  financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") in Exhibit 99.1, the Company uses a non-GAAP financial measure that it calls adjusted EBITDA (""Adjusted EBITDA""). This non-GAAP financial measure adjusts net income for interest and financing expense, net, net (income) loss attributable to non-redeemable non-controlling interests, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, adjustments to reflect Adjusted EBITDA from equity method investments, unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, non-cash charges, one-time non-recurring charges, major maintenance on Renewable Power, RNG development costs, virtual pipeline costs, and ITC proceeds, net. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information about the Company’s performance, for the following reasons: (1) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to assess the Company’s operating performance and make financial and operational decisions; (2) the measure excludes the effect of items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business; (3) the measure better aligns revenues with expenses; and (4) the measure is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company’s business. In future quarters, the Company may adjust for other expenditures, charges or gains to present non-GAAP financial measures that the Company’s management believes are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance.
Non-GAAP financial measures are limited as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s GAAP results. The Company expects to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures, adjusting for the items described above (and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Company’s management deems appropriate), and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses, charges or gains like the non-GAAP adjustments described above. Accordingly, unless expressly stated otherwise, the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. Moreover, because not all companies use identical measures and calculations, the Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the exhibit."

On May 7, 2025, Mistras Group, Inc. (the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"") issued a press release announcing the financial results for our first quarter of 2025, which ended March 31, 2025. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In the press release attached, the Company uses the terms “Adjusted EBITDA,” “free cash flow,” ""net debt"" and ""net income before special items,"" which are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The tables to the press release include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure under GAAP. Also, in the tables to the press release, the non-GAAP financial measures ""Segment and Total Company Income (Loss) before Special Items” (which includes operating income (loss) before special items) are presented and reconciled to financial measures under GAAP within the table ""Segment and Total Company Income (Loss) from Operations (GAAP) to Income (Loss) from Operations before Special Items (Non-GAAP)."" The non-GAAP financial measure ""Diluted EPS excluding Special Items,"" is presented and reconciled to the financial measure under GAAP within the table ""Net Income (Loss) (GAAP) and Diluted EPS (GAAP) to Net Income (Loss) Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP) and Diluted EPS Excluding Special Items (Non-GAAP)."" Information about these non-GAAP financial measures are included in the press release.
Our management uses and provides these non-GAAP financial measures as a measure of operating performance and liquidity to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations for the Company and for evaluating actual results against such expectations. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are also performance evaluation metrics used to determine incentive compensation for the Company's executive officers.
We believe that investors and other users of the financial statements benefit from the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures because they provide additional metrics to compare the Company's operating performance and liquidity on a consistent basis and measure underlying trends and results of the Company's business. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income before special items assist in evaluating our operating performance because they remove the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. For instance, Adjusted EBITDA generally excludes interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization, each of which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value and age of assets, capital structure, capital investment cycles and the method by which assets were acquired. It also eliminates stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense and is excluded by management when evaluating the underlying performance of our business operations.
Our management uses free cash flow when evaluating the performance of our business operations. This financial measure also takes into account cash used to purchase fixed assets needed for business operations which are not expensed. We believe this financial measure provides an additional tool to compare cash generated by our operations on a consistent basis and measure underlying trends and results in our business.
While Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are terms and financial measures commonly used by investors and securities analysts, they have limitations. As non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flows have no standard meaning and, therefore, may not be comparable with similar financial measures for other companies. Similarly, segment and total company income before special items and diluted EPS excluding special items has no standard meaning and may not be comparable to financial measures for other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are generally limited as analytical tools because they exclude charges and expenses we do incur as part of our operations as well as cash uses which are included in a GAAP cash flow statement. In addition, free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since items such as debt repayments are not deducted in determining such measure.
None of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.

On May 8, 2025, the Company announced interim new data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating soquelitinib in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The data demonstrated a favorable
safety and efficacy profile, including earlier and deeper responses in cohort 3 (200 mg twice per day, total daily dose 400 mg) compared
to cohorts 1 and 2 (100 mg twice per day and 200 mg once per day, total daily dose 200 mg). Overall, all three cohorts showed significant
responses in the soquelitinib treatment groups compared to placebo for clinically significant endpoints of EASI (Eczema Area and
Severity Index) 75 and IGA (Investigator Global Assessment) 0 or 1.
Soquelitinib Interim Data from the Atopic Dermatitis Phase 1 Clinical Trial
As of May 6, 2025, enrollment into cohorts 1, 2 and 3 has been completed for a total of 48
patients. The data covers 32 patients receiving soquelitinib and 12 placebos with 28-day follow-up, and four additional patients receiving
soquelitinib with 15-day follow-up from cohort 3. These four patients have not yet completed the 28-day treatment course.
Baseline patient characteristics are shown below in Table 1. Patients enrolled in cohort 3
had more severe disease with higher mean baseline EASI scores compared to cohorts 1 and 2. A higher proportion also failed prior systemic
therapies. Across all cohorts, the mean EASI scores are 22.3 and 21.2 for active and placebo, respectively. Placebo (n=12) and active
(n=36) treatment groups were well-balanced with regard to baseline characteristics.
Table 1: Patient Characteristics
The percent reduction in mean EASI scores at 28 days for the combined cohort 1 and 2 group was
54.6% for patients receiving soquelitinib and 30.6% for patients receiving placebo. In cohort 3, the percent reduction in mean EASI score
at 28 days was 71.1% for patients receiving soquelitinib and 42.1% for patients receiving placebo.
Figure 1 below shows the percent of patients that achieved IGA 0 or 1 or EASI 75 at day 28 of
treatment. The placebo patients from cohort 1 (n=4), cohort 2 (n=4) and cohort 3 (n=4) are combined, with no placebo patients achieving
IGA 0 or 1 or EASI 75. IGA 0 or 1 and EASI 75 have been determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to be clinically meaningful and approvable endpoints and have been the endpoints used in clinical trials for other FDA approved treatments
for atopic dermatitis.
Figure 1: Percent Patients Achieving Endpoints IGA 0 or 1, EASI 75 at Day 28 of
Treatment
The graphs below (Figures 2 and 3) show the kinetics of response for each of the cohorts and
for the combined cohorts 1, 2 and 3. The placebo patients (n=12) are combined in both graphs. Separation of the curves for patients receiving
active drug began at day 15 and increased by day 28 for cohorts 1 and 2. Cohort 3 patients experienced earlier and deeper separation from
placebo starting by day 8. The combined soquelitinib treatment group is significantly superior to placebo at day 28, p=0.03.
Figure 2: Percent Reduction in Mean EASI Score for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3.
Mean percent
change in EASI score over time is shown. Treatment beginning is designated “Baseline” and days post-baseline are shown. Screening
to baseline data is shown and demonstrates relative disease stability. The study blinding remains in effect for the entire 58-day period.
Numbers at the top of the graphs indicate numbers of patients evaluated at the various time points.
Figure 3: Percent Reduction in Mean EASI Score for Combined Cohorts 1, 2 and 3
.
The
data is displayed below with cohorts combined. Four active patients in cohort 3 have not yet reached day 28 of treatment.
Safety Data
Soquelitinib was well tolerated, with no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and no clinically significant
laboratory abnormalities observed in any of the cohorts. No interruption of drug dosing was seen in any of the cohorts. Grade 1/2 adverse
events (treatment related and unrelated) were seen in 33.3% of patients receiving soquelitinib and 25% receiving placebo. Only one treatment
related adverse event of grade 1 nausea was reported with soquelitinib treatment.
Serum Cytokine and Other Biomarker Studies
As reported previously, relationships between reductions in certain cytokines with improvement
in EASI scores were observed. Reductions in serum cytokine levels were seen for IL-5, IL-9, IL-17, IL-31, IL-33, TSLP and TARC. Differences
between responding and non-responding patients were found, while no such relationships were seen in the placebo group. Increasing trends
were seen in numbers of circulating T regulatory cells, consistent with the presumed mechanism of action of soquelitinib.
Soquelitinib Atopic Dermatitis Phase 1 Clinical Trial Design and Protocol Update
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial was designed
to enroll 64 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that previously failed one prior topical or systemic therapy. Patients
were planned to be enrolled into one of four dosing cohorts in a 3:1 ratio (12 active and four placebo) to receive either soquelitinib
or placebo. The cohorts are sequentially enrolled and will examine 100 mg orally twice per day, 200 mg orally once per day, 200 mg orally
twice per day and 400 mg orally once per day. Patients are treated for 28 days and are then followed for an additional 30 days with no
therapy. The Company amended the clinical trial protocol to replace cohort 4 (400 mg once per day) with 24 patients randomized 1:1 between
active and placebo. Treatment for this group will be extended to 8 weeks with additional 30-day follow-up with no treatment. The dose
level for this group is planned to be the same as cohort 3 – 200 mg orally twice per day.
These doses were selected based on the Company’s prior experience evaluating soquelitinib
in T cell lymphoma patients. The doses in the atopic dermatitis trial studied in cohorts 1 and 2 are lower than the 200 mg orally twice
a day dosing regimen (same dose as cohort 3 of the atopic dermatitis trial), which is the level that has been shown to provide complete
ITK occupancy and that is being evaluated in the Company’s ongoing registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of soquelitinib in peripheral
T cell lymphoma.
The primary endpoints include safety and tolerability. Efficacy, measured by improvement in EASI score
and IGA, are secondary endpoints. Reduction in itch and various cytokine biomarkers are exploratory endpoints. EASI scores are
also evaluated by the percent of patients that achieve a specified percent reduction in EASI score – EASI 50
for patients that achieved a 50% reduction; EASI 75 for a 75% reduction; and EASI 90 for a 90% reduction. Corvus and
a data monitoring committee monitor the data from the trial as the trial progresses.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements
related to the potential safety and efficacy of soquelitinib and the Company’s conduct of and monitoring of data from clinical trials.
All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K are forward-looking statements. These
statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,”“estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond the Company’s control.
The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number
of factors, including but not limited to, risks detailed in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended
March 31, 2025, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about the date hereof, as well as other documents that may be
filed by the Company from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, the following factors, among others,
could cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements: the Company’s ability
to demonstrate sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety in its clinical trials of its product candidates; the accuracy of the Company’s
estimates relating to its ability to initiate and/or complete preclinical studies and clinical trials and release data from such studies
and clinical trials; the results of preclinical studies and interim data from clinical trials not being predictive of future results;
the Company’s ability to enroll sufficient numbers of patients in its clinical trials; the unpredictability of the regulatory process;
regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; the costs of clinical trials may exceed expectations; and the Company’s
ability to raise additional capital. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, it cannot guarantee that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur,
and the timing of events and circumstances and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All such statements speak only as of the date made,
and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise."

Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on
Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements
involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to possible or assume future results of our business,
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, plans and objectives. You can generally identify forward-looking statements because
they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,”“could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,”“estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other
similar expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
on our current expectations and projections regarding future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties
and other factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (333-278629)
(the “Registration Statement”), and elsewhere in the Registration Statement. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking
statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking
statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those projected in the
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K include, but are not limited to, statements
regarding: the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate; our ability to successfully implement our business strategy,
effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings
of such strategies and actions; our ability to recruit and retain qualified driving associates, independent contractors and third-party
auto transportation and logistics companies; an increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or other claims; our expectations regarding
the successful implementation of our acquisitions; geopolitical developments and additional changes in international trade policies and
relations; the effect of any international conflicts or terrorist activities, on the United States and global economies in general, the
transportation industry, or us in particular, and what effects these events will have on our costs and the demand for our services; our
ability to manage our network capacity and cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses, and match it to shifting and
future customer volume levels; our ability to compete effectively against current and future competitors; our ability to maintain our
profitability despite quarterly fluctuations in our results, whether due to seasonality, large cyclical events, or other causes; and our
future financial and operating results; our expectations regarding the period during which we will qualify as an emerging growth company
under the JOBS Act; and our use of the net proceeds from the IPO and the sufficiency of our existing cash to fund our future operating
expenses and capital expenditure requirements.
The forward-looking statements
made in this Current Report on Form 8-K relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect
the occurrence of unanticipated events. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking
statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION​On May 8, 2025 Information Services Group, Inc. (“ISG” or the “Company”) released its earnings for the first quarter 2025 which ended on March 31, 2025 and is furnishing a copy of the earnings release to the Securities and Exchange Commission under Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, ISG will discuss its financial results during a teleconference call on Friday, May 9, 2025 at 9:00am (ET). To access the teleconference call, go to ISG’s website at www.isg-one.com.  The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Exchange Act.​ISG reports all financial information required in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  ISG believes, however, that evaluating its ongoing operating results will be enhanced if it also discloses certain non-GAAP information. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash and certain other special charges that many investors believe may obscure the user’s overall understanding of ISG’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future.  ISG believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of the financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency of key measures used to evaluate the Company’s performance.​ISG provides adjusted EBITDA (defined as net income, plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, non-cash stock compensation, interest accretion associated with contingent consideration, acquisition and disposition-related cost,  and severance, integration and other expense), adjusted net income (defined as net income, plus amortization of intangible assets, non-cash stock compensation, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, interest accretion associated with contingent consideration, acquisition and disposition-related cost, and severance, integration, and other expense on a tax-adjusted basis), adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA margin and selected financial data on a constant currency basis which are non-GAAP measures that the Company believes provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and financial implications of foreign currency translations, which management believes are not indicative of ISG’s core operations. These non-GAAP measures are used by ISG to evaluate the Company’s business strategies and management’s performance.​Non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely applicable GAAP measure.  Non-GAAP measures are provided as additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.​ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS​(d)

On May 2, 2025, Dean Owner LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Dean Owner”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clipper Realty Inc. (the “Company”), entered into the Multifamily Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with MF1 Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MF1 Capital”), dated as of May 2, 2025. In addition, on May 2, 2025, Dean Member LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Dean Member”) and MF1 Capital entered into the Mezzanine Multifamily Loan and Security Agreement (the “Mezzanine Loan Agreement” and together with the Loan Agreement, the “New Loan Agreements”) with MF1 Capital, a company not affiliated with the Company dated as of May 2, 2025.
The Loan Agreement provides for the $115 million loan to Dean Owner, and the Mezzanine Loan Agreement provides for the $45 million loan to Dean Member (collectively, the “Loans”). The Loans have an initial May 2027 maturity date, with three one-year extensions available upon meeting the applicable extension conditions, and bear interest at 2.65% rate, plus 1-Month CME Term SOFR (with a floor of 2.25%). The Dean Member can borrow up to an additional $18.2 million under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement based on meeting various performance targets over the term of the loan. Under the Loan Agreement, the Company deposited with MF1 Capital (i) $4.3 million for a shortfall reserve account to pay interest and operating expenses during the initial lease up period of the Dean Street Property, and (ii) $1.6 million for completion reserve deposits towards the completion of the construction of the building.
The New Loan Agreements also contain customary representations, covenants, and events of default.
In addition, the Company purchased an interest rate cap with US Bank that caps the SOFR portion of the interest rate on the Loans at 6%.
On May 2, 2025, concurrently with entering into the Loan Agreements, the Company repaid its loans under: (i) the Credit Agreement by and among Dean Owner, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Valley National Bank, as Administrative Agent, dated as of August 10, 2023 (the “Credit Agreement”), and (ii) the Mezzanine Loan Agreement, dated as of August 10, 2023, by and among BADF 953 Dean Street Lender LLC, as Administrative Agent, the lenders party hereto, and Dean Member, as borrower (the “Mezzanine Agreement” and together with the Credit Agreement, “Prior Loan Agreements”). The Prior Loan Agreements provided for a $115.0 million senior loans under the Credit Agreement and $8.0 million note under the Mezzanine Agreement, which the Company used as construction loans related to its Dean Street Property. In connection with entering into the New Loan Agreements, the Prior Loan Agreements were terminated (pursuant to the terms therein), whereby the borrowers paid to the lenders approximately $126 million of principal and accrued interest outstanding under the Prior Loan Agreements.
The Company incurred no fees or costs as a result of the termination of the Prior Loan Agreements, and the Company incurred approximately $3.1 million in closing costs for the New Loan Agreements.
The foregoing description of the New Loan Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the New Loan Agreements, which will be filed as exhibits to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2025 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

On May 5, 2025, the board of directors of Vor Biopharma Inc. (the “Company”) approved the wind down of the Company’s clinical and manufacturing operations as the Company conducts a process to explore strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, which includes a plan to implement a reduction of the Company’s workforce by 147 full-time employees, or approximately 95% of the Company’s current employee base (the “Wind Down”). The total costs related to the Wind Down are estimated to be approximately $19.3 million. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $3.5 million in contract termination and other costs related to the discontinuation of its clinical trials, approximately $0.5 million in contract termination and other costs related to the exit from its manufacturing facility, an approximately $4.4 million loss on disposal of fixed assets, and approximately $10.9 million in costs related to the workforce reduction. The Company expects to complete the workforce reduction by the end of the second quarter of 2025 and to incur a significant majority of the costs related to the Wind Down in the second quarter of 2025. The Company may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the Wind Down. These estimates of the costs that the Company expects to incur, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ."

As part of the workforce reduction plan described above in Item 2.05, on May 8, 2025, the Company terminated the employment of Han Choi as Chief Financial Officer and Tirtha Chakraborty, PhD as Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Technical Operations, effective as of May 16, 2025 (the “Separation Date”), without cause.
In connection with their departures, the Company expects to enter into a separation agreement with each of Dr. Choi and Dr. Chakraborty (each, a “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Separation Agreements, each executive will receive a lump sum severance payment equal to ten months of his base salary in effect on the Separation Date, less applicable taxes and withholdings, and continuation of health coverage under COBRA for up to ten months. The Separation Agreements also will contain a general release of claims in favor of the Company.
The Company also expects to enter into a consulting agreement with Dr. Chakraborty pursuant to which he will provide transition services to the Company, subject to mutual agreement of terms."

Pursuant to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “Charter”) of Bukit Jalil Global Acquisition 1 Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Company”), the Company currently has until June 30, 2024 to complete its initial business combination. However, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to June 30, 2025, each by an additional one-month extension, subject to Bukit Jalil Global Investment Ltd., a Cayman Islands company, the sponsor of the Company (the “Sponsor”) and/or its designee, depositing $100,000 (the “Monthly Extension Fee”) into the trust account of the Company (the “Trust Account”).
On or about May 1, 2025, an aggregate of $100,000 of the Monthly Extension Fee was deposited into the Trust Account for the Company’s public shareholders (the “Monthly Extension Payment”), which enables the Company to extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial business combination by one month from April 30, 2025 to May 30, 2025 (the “Extension”). The Extension is the eleventh of the twelve Monthly Extensions permitted under the Company’s Charter.
In connection with the Monthly Extension Payment, on May 6, 2025, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note of $100,000 (the “Note”) to the Sponsor.

The payees of the Note, the Sponsor, has the right, but not the obligation, to convert the Note, in whole or in part, respectively, into private units (the “Units”) of the Company, each consisting of one ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Ordinary Share”), one-half of one warrant, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of a business combination, as described in the prospectus of the Company (File No: 333- 272605), by providing the Company with written notice of the intention to convert at least two business days prior to the closing of the business combination. The number of Units to be received by the Sponsor in connection with such conversion shall be an amount determined by dividing (x) the sum of the outstanding principal amount payable to the Sponsor by (y) $10.00.
The issuance of the Note was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
A copy of the Note is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Note does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Note."

At the Special Meeting, the following proposals were considered:
1.
Merger Agreement Proposal
.
A proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which provides that, among other things and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the parties thereto will consummate the Merger, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, pursuant to and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “Merger Agreement Proposal”).

On April 30, 2025 and May 1, 2025, ClimateRock (the “Company”)
held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Meeting”). At the Meeting, the following proposals were
considered and acted upon by the shareholders of the Company:
(a) a proposal to amend the
Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “Articles”) to extend the date by
which the Company has to consummate an initial Business Combination from May 2, 2025 to November 2, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined
by the Company’s board of directors in its sole discretion) (the “Extension Amendment Proposal” and such amendment
to the Articles, the “Extension Amendment”);
(b) a proposal to amend the
Articles to eliminate the limitation that the Company may not redeem Public Shares to the extent that such redemption would result in
the Company having net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended) of less than $5,000,001 (the “Redemption Limitation”) in order to allow the Company to redeem Public Shares
irrespective of whether such redemption would exceed the Redemption Limitation (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal”and such amendment, together with the Extension Amendment, the “Articles Amendment”); and
(c)
a
proposal to approve the adjournment of the Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of
proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of any of the foregoing proposals
(the “Adjournment Proposal”).

Shareholders
holding 2,058,545 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account.
The final per share redemption amount is currently being calculated.  The Company has estimated it to be approximately $12.17 per
share and will file an amended Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose the final amount if it is materially different from the estimated
amount. As a result, approximately $25.06 million will be removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders (the “Meeting Redemptions”).
Following the Meeting Redemptions, there will be 406,678 Public Shares issued and outstanding.
The

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K about the Company’s future expectations, plans and prospects, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such statements include statements regarding the Company’s strategy, future operations, prospects, plans, objectives of management, the expected timeline regarding the clinical development of product candidates, including the announcement of data, the potential activity and efficacy of product candidates in preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the timing and outcome of planned meetings with regulatory authorities. The words “aim,” “anticipate,” “approach,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “design,” “designed to,” “engineered,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “promise,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would,” or the negative of these terms, or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. The Company may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: uncertainties inherent in the development of product candidates, including the conduct of research activities, the initiation and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; uncertainties as to the availability and timing of results from preclinical studies and clinical trials; the timing of and the Company’s ability to submit and obtain regulatory approval for investigational new drug applications; whether results from preclinical studies will be predictive of the results of later preclinical studies and clinical trials; whether preliminary or interim data from a clinical trial will be predictive of the future results of the trial and future clinical trials; the Company’s ability to manage cash resources and obtain additional cash resources to fund the Company’s foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; as well as the risks and uncertainties identified in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and in subsequent filings the Company may make with the SEC. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this Current Report on Form 8-K represent the Company’s views as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its views to change. However, while the Company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements
should not be relied upon as representing the Company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K."

On May 8, 2025, XBP Europe Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”)
announced that it had received notice from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) confirming that the Company had demonstrated
compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). Consequently, the Panel determined to continue the listing of the Company’s securities
on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) pertains to the continued listing requirements for companies on The Nasdaq
Capital Market (“NCM”), which requires that a company maintain a minimum market value of listed securities of at least $35
million.
As previously disclosed, on April 24, 2024, the Company received a
deficiency letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that the listing of its Common Stock was
not in compliance with the minimum $15 million market value of publicly held shares requirement (the “NGM MVPHS Requirement”)
for a period of 30 consecutive business days, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global
Market (the “NGM”). Due to the Company’s non-compliance with the NGM MVPHS Requirement, on September 4, 2024, the Company
requested to transfer the listing of its securities to the NCM.
On October 18, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the “Delisting
Determination Letter”) from Nasdaq stating that the Company had not regained compliance with the NGM MVPHS Requirement. The Company
subsequently requested a hearing before the Panel pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(d), which automatically stayed the suspension and/or delisting
of the Company’s securities pending the completion of the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted
by the Panel. At the Panel hearing on December 12, 2024, the Company reiterated its request to transfer to the NCM and presented a plan
to demonstrate compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) by achieving a market value of listed securities of at least $35 million no later
than April 4, 2025.
On January 13, 2025, Nasdaq notified the Company that the Panel had
granted the Company’s request to continue its application with the Nasdaq staff to transfer its securities to the NCM, provided
it demonstrated compliance with the minimum market value of listed securities requirement on or before April 4, 2025. The Company successfully
demonstrated compliance with this requirement and was informed on May 1, 2025, that it met the requirements of the NCM, thereby implying
that its application to transfer to the NCM had also been granted.

On May 8, 2025, ModivCare Inc. (""ModivCare"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2025. A copy of the press release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference."

On May 5, 2025, the Company
received a notification letter (the “Notice”)
from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the Company’s market value of publicly held shares (“MVPHS”), which value calculation under applicable Nasdaq rule excludes shares held by beneficial owners of more than 10% of our total shares outstanding and shares held by our officers and directors, closed below the $15,000,000 MVPHS threshold required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(3)(C).
The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until November 1, 2025, to regain compliance with the MVPHS requirement. To regain compliance, the Company’s MVPHS must close at or above $15,000,000 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days prior to the expiration of the 180-day compliance period. In the event that the Company does not regain compliance with the MVPHS requirement prior to the expiration of the 180-day compliance period, the Company will receive written notification from Nasdaq that the Company’s securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. Alternatively, the Company may apply to transfer its securities to The Nasdaq Capital Market, provided that the Company then meets the continued listing requirements on The Nasdaq Capital Market.
The Company intends to monitor its MVPHS and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options to regain compliance with the MVPHS requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the MVPHS requirement.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements contained in this current report constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are predictive in nature and are identified generally by the use of the terms “intended”, “expected”, “will”, and “anticipates”, and similar words or expressions indicating possible future expectations, events or actions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company’s business and its industry, and are not guarantees of future performance. These statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict, which may cause actual events to be materially different from those expressed or implied herein. Statements about the Company’s intentions concerning its compliance with applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq are forward-looking statements. The Company has provided additional information about the risks facing its business and the Company in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and in its subsequent periodic and current reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, filed by it with the SEC. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statements were made and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth herein and in the periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) identified above, which you should read in their entirety before making an investment decision with respect to the Company’s securities. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law."

On May 7, 2025, Nocera, Inc. (the “Company”)
received written confirmation from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating that the Company had regained compliance
with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires the timely filing of all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
As previously disclosed in the Company’s
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 28, 2025, the Company received a notification from Nasdaq on April 24, 2025, indicating that
the Company was not in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) due to the Company’s failure to timely file its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”). The Company filed the Form 10-K with the SEC on May
6, 2025. As a result of such filing, Nasdaq has confirmed that the Company had regained compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), and the
matter is now closed.
A copy of Nasdaq’s compliance letter, dated
May 7, 2025, is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The Company also issued

On May 8, 2025, Acurx Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase
Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”), pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase
up to $12.0 million in shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share.
Concurrently with the execution
of the Purchase Agreement on May 8, 2025, we also entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”)
with Lincoln Park, relating to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), of the
offer and sale of the securities that have been and may be issued and sold by us to Lincoln Park, from time to time in our sole discretion,
from and after the date of this report, under the Purchase Agreement and to take such other specified actions to maintain such registration
under the Securities Act.
Under the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated
to purchase, up to $12.0 million in shares of our common stock. Such sales of our common stock, if any, will be subject to certain limitations,
and may occur from time to time, at our sole discretion, over the 24-month period commencing on the date that a registration statement
covering the resale by Lincoln Park of shares that have been and may be issued under the Purchase Agreement is declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and a final prospectus, if necessary, in connection therewith is filed and
the other conditions in the Purchase Agreement are satisfied (the date on which all such conditions are satisfied, the “Commencement
Date”).
After the Commencement Date,
on any business day, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 60,000 shares of our common stock (each, a “Regular Purchase”);
provided that the share amount under a Regular Purchase may be increased to up to 90,000 shares or up to 120,000 shares if the closing
sale price of our common stock is not below $2.00 or $3.00, respectively, on the business day on which we initiate the Regular Purchase.
However, Lincoln Park’s maximum commitment in any single Regular Purchase may not exceed $500,000. Each Regular Purchase is subject
to adjustment for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction
as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share for each Regular Purchase will be 97% of the lower of (i) the lowest
sale price of our common stock on the business day on which we initiate the Regular Purchase and (ii) the average of the three lowest
closing sale prices of our common stock during the 10-business day period immediately preceding the business day on which we initiate
the Regular Purchase. In addition to Regular Purchases, we may also direct Lincoln Park to purchase other amounts of common stock as accelerated
purchases and as additional accelerated purchases, subject to limits specified in the Purchase Agreement, at a purchase price per share
calculated as specified in the Purchase Agreement.
Sales of shares of our common
stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including,
among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determination as to the appropriate sources of funding
for our operations. We expect that any proceeds we receive from such sales will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
In addition, under applicable
Nasdaq rules, we may not issue or sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement more than 19.99% of the shares of our common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement (the “Exchange Cap”), unless (i) we obtain stockholder
approval to issue shares in excess of the Exchange Cap or (ii) the average price of all applicable sales of our common stock to Lincoln
Park under the Purchase Agreement equals or exceeds $0.3545 per share (which represents the lower of (A) the official closing price of our
common stock on Nasdaq immediately preceding the signing of the Purchase Agreement and (B) the average official closing price of our common
stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Purchase Agreement).
In any event, the Purchase Agreement specifically provides that we may not issue or sell any shares of our common stock under the Purchase
Agreement if such issuance or sale would breach any applicable Nasdaq rules.
Lincoln Park has no right
to require us to sell any shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, but Lincoln Park is obligated to make purchases as we direct, subject
to the conditions and limitations in the Purchase Agreement including beneficial ownership limitations.
In connection with entering
into the Purchase Agreement, on May 8, 2025, we issued 899,258 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park in consideration for its commitment
to purchase shares under the Purchase Agreement.
The Purchase Agreement and
the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, conditions, covenants, Suspension Events (as defined
in the Purchase Agreement) and indemnification obligations of the parties. We agreed not to effect any issuance of, or enter into any
agreement to effect any issuance of, shares of common stock or common stock equivalents involving a “variable rate transaction,”as such term is defined the Purchase Agreement, subject to limited exceptions, including our ability to issue and sell our common stock
pursuant to our previously announced “at-the-market offering,” through the 24-month anniversary of the Purchase Agreement.
Lincoln Park agreed not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect, short selling of or hedging with respect
to our common stock during the term of the Purchase Agreement. We may terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time after the Commencement
Date, at no cost or penalty.
This report shall not constitute
an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any shares of our common stock, nor shall there be any sale of shares of common
stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification
under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.
The foregoing summary of the
material terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, copies of which are attached as exhibits to this report, and each of which
is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The representations, warranties and covenants in such agreements were made only for
purposes of such agreements and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements, and may be subject
to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties."

The information contained above in Item 1.01 is
incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.
In the Purchase Agreement,
Lincoln Park represented to the Company, among other things, that it is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in
Rule 501(a)(3) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The shares of common stock
that were issued and may be issued to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement were not and will not be registered under the Securities
Act or qualified under any state securities laws. Such shares were issued and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act.

On May 7, 2025, Palatin Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with institutional investors named on the signature pages thereto pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and issue, in a reasonable best efforts registered public offering (the “Offering”), an aggregate of 76,666,667 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the “Shares”) of which also consisted of common stock equivalents in lieu thereof, series f common warrants (the “Series F Common Warrants”) to purchase up to 76,666,667 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Series F Warrant Shares”), series g common warrants (the “Series G Common Warrants”) to purchase up to 76,666,667 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Series G Warrant Shares”), and series h common warrants (the “Series H Common Warrants” and together with the Series F Common Warrants and Series G Common Warrants, the “Common Warrants”) to purchase up to 76,666,667 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Series H Warrant Shares” and together with the Series F Warrants Shares and Series G Warrant Shares, the “Common Warrant Shares”). The Shares were offered at an offering price of $0.15 per Share. The Common Warrants were offered concurrently with the Shares.
The Series F Common Warrants will have an exercise price of $0.30 per share, will be immediately exercisable and will expire on the five-year anniversary of the original issuance date, subject to the certain terms as defined in such Series F Common Warrant. The Series G Common Warrants will have an exercise price of $0.15 per share, will be immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) the 24-month anniversary of the original issuance date or (ii) the expiration of the FDA Exercise Period (as such term is defined in the Series G Common Warrant).

The gross proceeds from the Offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and offering expenses, were expected to be $11.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds received from the Offering for general working capital purposes.
As described in more detail in Item 3.01 below, after the Purchase Agreement was executed, on May 7, 2025 the Company received notice from NYSE Regulation that it had suspended trading of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE American LLC stock exchange (“NYSE American”). Subsequently, also on May 7, 2025, the Company issued a press release discussing matters disclosed in Item 3.01 below. A copy of such press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Also on May 7, 2025, certain investors notified the Company that an event listed under Section 2.3(b)(v) of the Purchase Agreement had occurred and that such investors would not proceed to closing in connection with the Offering.
As a result, on May 8, 2025, the Company raised approximately $1.1 million in net proceeds from the reduced Offering. The Company intends to use the net proceeds received from the Offering for general working capital purposes.
The securities were offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-286280) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) and declared effective on May 6, 2025.
The Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties that the parties made to, and solely for the benefit of, each other in the context of all of the terms and conditions of that agreement and in the context of the specific relationship between the parties. The Purchase Agreement also contains customary conditions to closing, termination rights of the parties, certain indemnification obligations of the Company and ongoing covenants for the Company, including a prohibition on the Company’s sale and issuance of additional securities for a period of 45 days from the closing date of the Offering and entering into variable rate transactions (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for a period of 4 months from the closing date of the Offering, subject to certain exceptions.
A holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the Common Warrants to the extent that the holder would own more than 9.99% (or, at the holder’s option upon closing of the Offering, 4.99%) of the number of shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock immediately after exercise. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% upon notice to us, provided that any increase in this limitation will not be effective until 61 days after such notice from the holder to us and such increase or decrease will apply only to the holder providing such notice.
On May 7, 2025, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement (the “Placement Agent Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (“A.G.P.”), as lead placement agent and Laidlaw & Company (UK) Ltd., as co-placement agent (“Laidlaw,” and together with A.G.P., the “Placement Agents”), pursuant to which the Company engaged A.G.P. and Laidlaw as the exclusive placement agents in connection with the Offering.

No Offer or Solicitation
As previously reported on a Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on December 6, 2024, on December 4, 2024, the Company, Roosevelt Resources, LP, a Texas limited partnership (“Roosevelt”), and certain other parties entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) providing for the combination of the two companies in an all-stock transaction.  Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, Arcadia will issue to the partners of Roosevelt shares of Arcadia common stock in exchange for all of the equity interests in Roosevelt.
This Report, including the information contained herein and the exhibits filed or furnished herewith, is not intended to and does not constitute (i) a solicitation of a proxy, consent or approval with respect to any securities or in respect of the proposed Exchange transaction with Roosevelt or (ii) an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for any securities pursuant to the proposed transaction or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law.  No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or an exemption therefrom.
Subject to certain exceptions to be approved by the relevant regulators or certain facts to be ascertained, no public offer will be made directly or indirectly, in or into any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of such jurisdiction, or by use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality (including without limitation, facsimile transmission, telephone and the internet) of interstate or foreign commerce, or any facility of a national securities exchange, of any such jurisdiction.
Additional Information for Stockholders
In connection with the proposed transaction, Arcadia intends to file relevant materials with the SEC and previously filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the “Registration Statement”), File no. 333-284972, that includes a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus, with the SEC on February 14, 2025.  After the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, Arcadia intends to mail a definitive proxy statement/prospectus to the stockholders of Arcadia.  This Report is not a substitute for the proxy statement/prospectus or the Registration Statement or for any other document that Arcadia may file with the SEC and send to Arcadia’s stockholders or the partners of Roosevelt in connection with the proposed transaction.  INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF ARCADIA ARE URGED TO CAREFULLY AND THOROUGHLY READ THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, AS EACH MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED BY ARCADIA WITH THE SEC, WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ARCADIA, ROOSEVELT, THE PROPOSED EXCHANGE TRANSACTION, THE RISKS RELATED THERETO AND RELATED MATTERS.
Investors and stockholders will be able to obtain free copies of the Registration Statement and proxy statement/prospectus, as each may be amended from time to time, and other relevant documents filed by Arcadia with the SEC (when they become available) through the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.

In addition, investors and stockholders should note that Arcadia communicates with investors and the public using its website (www.arcadiabio.com) where anyone will be able to obtain free copies of the proxy statement/prospectus and other documents filed by Arcadia with the SEC.  Stockholders and Roosevelt partners are urged to read the proxy statement/prospectus and the other relevant materials when they become available before making any voting or investment decision with respect to the proposed transactions.
Participants in the Proxy Solicitation
Arcadia, Roosevelt and their respective directors, partners and certain of their officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed, under SEC rules, to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from Arcadia’s stockholders in connection with the proposed transactions.  Information regarding the officers and directors of Arcadia is included in Arcadia’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, filed with the SEC, including any information incorporated therein by reference, its
definitive proxy statement for its 2024 annual meeting of stockholders filed with the SEC on May 16, 2024, and in the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto as filed with the SEC.  Additional information regarding such persons, as well as information regarding Roosevelt’s directors, managers and officers and other persons who may be deemed participants in the proposed transaction, will be set forth in the Registration Statement and proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments thereto, and other materials, when they are filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction.

Acquisition of Assets
As previously disclosed, in February 2025, Catheter Precision, Inc. (the “Company”) formed its subsidiary Cardionomix, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“Cardionomix”), in order to pursue the acquisition of certain assets of Cardionomic, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which has ceased operations. We issued 82% of the common stock of Cardionomix to the Company, 5% to David Jenkins, our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board, 7% to FatBoy Capital L.P., an entity controlled by Mr. Jenkins, and 6% to certain business associates of Mr. Jenkins. These minority interests were issued to compensate these persons for bringing this business opportunity to the Company.
On April 18, 2025, the Company and Cardionomix entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) with Cardionomic (assignment for the benefit of creditors), LLC, a California limited liability company (the “Seller”), in its sole and limited capacity as assignee for the benefit of creditors of Cardionomic, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Assignor”), pursuant to which Cardionomix purchased assets related to the Assignor's late-stage treatment in development for acute decompensated heart failure (the “Purchased Assets”), consisting of patents and trademarks related to the Assignor's Cardiac Pulmonary Nerve Simulation (CNPS) System.  In the Agreement, the Seller represents that Assignor had previously transferred ownership of all of its right, title and interest in and to all of its tangible and intangible assets, including the Purchased Assets, to Seller, and, in so doing, also designated Seller to act, pursuant to California law, as the assignee for the benefit of creditors of Assignor. The asset purchase closed on May 5, 2025.
Cardionomix acquired the Purchased Assets on an “AS IS” and “WHERE IS” basis, with no representations or warranties as to merchantability, fitness or use from Seller and no representations from or privity with Assignor, in exchange for the issuance by the Company of 1,000,000 restricted shares of the Company's common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Share Consideration”) and the issuance by Cardionomix of a promissory note (the ""Note"") in the amount of $1.5 million, with simple interest accruing at 4% per annum on the principal thereof and no interest or principal payable until the maturity date of the Note, which will be May 5, 2028.  Other material terms of the Note are set forth under Item 2.03 below. The Purchased Assets were delivered pursuant to the Agreement free and clear of certain specified known encumbrances.
Cardionomix has no significant assets other than the Purchased Assets. Accordingly, it will need to raise funds in order to develop the Purchased Assets. We have begun discussions with potential investors, but there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise sufficient funds for this purpose on a timely basis or at all.  Any such financing is likely to entail the issuance of additional securities by Cardionomix to such investors, which securities are also likely to provide certain corporate governance rights.  Such an issuance is expected to reduce the Company's ownership interest in Cardionomix, although it is expected to remain a majority owned consolidated entity.  The information set forth in this Current Report on Form 8-K is not an offer to sell or exchange, or solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities.
The foregoing summary of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 1.01 in its entirety by reference.
Caution Regarding Forward Looking Statements
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as ""believe,"" ""anticipate,"" ""may,"" ""might,"" ""can,"" ""could,"" ""continue,"" ""depends,"" ""expect,"" ""expand,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""predict,"" ""plan,"" ""rely,"" ""should,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""seek,"" “promising,” “potential,” ""seeking"" or the negative of these terms and other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Such forward-looking statements include our descriptions of our plans to procure financing for our general operations and to develop our assets.  These forward-looking statements are subject to the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, express and implied statements regarding our expectation to conclude financing for Cardionomix. The Company's expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a result of uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances, including but not limited to risks and uncertainties included under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's 2024 Form 10-K filed with the SEC and available at www.sec.gov. These risks and uncertainties include, but aren't limited to: that our ability to develop and commercialize the assets could be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain protection of the patents and trade names related thereto, which we are acquiring on an as is basis without recourse; that we may not be able to obtain the financing for Cardionomix that we anticipate and/or such financing even if obtained may not be adequate for the development of the assets; and that we may not adequately address the lessons learned from the pilot studies related to the assets, which included fatigue to nerves if stimulation is delivered for too long; high amplitude stimulation can lead to unstable hemodynamics, rhythm disturbances, and patient sensation; optimal stimulation response is dependent on more than just contractility; stimulation beyond 48 hours did not show additional benefit; stimulator modifications required to reduce procedure time, complexity, and improve user experience; and minor catheter modifications needed to accommodate larger anatomy in heart failure patients. FDA review of the assets is likely to be costly and lengthy, and there is no guarantee that clearance and approval will ever occur or occur on a timetable that is beneficial to the Company. Additionally, Cardionomix has other, minority investors aside from the Company, and future financings are expected to involve the issuance of securities by Cardionomix, which will reduce the Company’s share in the profits, if any, from the Purchased Assets and Cardionomix, and is likely to involve the grant of special corporate governance rights to other subsidiary investors so that the Company will not have unfettered control of Cardionomix. There is no guarantee that the success of the Cardionomic pilot studies will be repeated in future trials or ultimately lead to a successful commercialization of the Purchased Assets. The medical device industry in general is highly competitive, and some of our competitors have longer, more established operating histories, with significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other resources. The Purchased Assets are not the only device-based neuromodulation therapy currently in development for the treatment of heart failure and further must also compete against potential new drug therapies. In general, results of anticipated trials may not turn out as we currently expect, and future trials may not occur on the time tables we expect or may be more costly than anticipated. In addition, our forward looking statements are subject to the following additional uncertainties and risks: we do not have sufficient liquidity to fund our business unless we are able to obtain additional financing or enter into a strategic transaction that would provide additional liquidity during the next three months, we will not be able to reach profitability unless we are able to achieve our product expansion and growth goals, our research and development and commercialization efforts may depend on entering into agreements with corporate collaborators, we have in the past entered into joint marketing agreements with respect to our products, and may again enter into additional joint marketing agreements in the future that could reduce our revenues from product sales, if we experience significant disruptions in our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected, litigation and other legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, if we make acquisitions or divestitures, we could encounter difficulties that harm our business, failure to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel could also impede our growth, failure to maintain effective internal controls could cause our investors to lose confidence in us and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, we have determined that our internal controls and disclosure controls were not effective as of March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2024, and as a result, without effective remediation of the material weaknesses that we have identified, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, our revenues may depend on our customers' receipt of adequate reimbursement from private insurers and government sponsored healthcare programs, we may be unable to compete successfully with companies in our highly competitive industry, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do, our future operating results depend upon our ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms or according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, and suppliers may fail to deliver components, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively or obtain these components on such terms, if hospitals, physicians and patients do not accept our current and future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any, our medical device operations are subject to pervasive and continuing FDA regulatory requirements, our products may be subject to additional recalls, revocations or suspensions after receiving FDA or foreign approval or clearance, which could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business, changes in trade policies among the U.S. and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher tariffs by the U.S. and/or its trading partners could increase our expenses, require us to increase prices, potentially lowering demand for our products, and/or reduce our revenues and operating results, and such increase , or the imposition of other barriers to international trade, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. Our efforts more generally to seek financing to fund general operations and develop our other assets are subject to the vagaries of the markets and the economy in general and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are favorable to the Company or at all.  The risks and uncertainties described above may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused significant economic uncertainty, or other pandemics, supply chain disruptions from the Ukraine war or Israeli-Hamas conflict and otherwise, and ongoing volatility in the stock markets and the U.S. economy in general.
The forward-looking statements included in this Form 8-K are made only as of the date hereof. The Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

As noted above, we have begun discussions with potential investors in order to obtain financing to develop the Purchased Assets.  Our description under Item 1.01 above related to such potential financing is incorporated into this Item 7.01 in full.  We are also actively seeking additional financing for the Company in order to fund our ongoing operations, develop our other assets and pursue general research and development, including financing through both public and private offerings, including a proposed at the market offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as private placements of our securities, including our common stock and other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, such as convertible preferred stock and warrants.  There can be no guarantees that any such financings will come to fruition, and issuances of equity in connection therewith may be dilutive to current stakeholders.  Our plans and proposals to seek such financings are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above under the heading “Caution Regarding Forward Looking Statements” contained in Item 1.01."

On May 2, 2025, Copley Acquisition Corp (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 17,250,000
units (the “Units”), including 2,250,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.
Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Ordinary Shares”), and
one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Warrants”) with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary
Share at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $172,500,000

Unit, generating aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $4,093,750 (the “Private Proceeds” and together with the Public
Proceeds, the “Offering Proceeds”).
A total of $173,362,500, or $10.05 per Unit, comprised of the net proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $5,175,000 of the underwriter’s

On May 2, 2025, Republic Digital
Acquisition Company (the “Company”) consummated its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 30,000,000
units (the “Units”), including 3,600,000 Units issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their
over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A
Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each, a “Warrant”), with each
whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a
price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $300,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing
of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 7,280,000 warrants
(the “Private Placement Warrants”), with each Private Placement Warrant exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary
share at $11.50 per share. Of the 7,280,000 Private Placement Warrants, 4,640,000 Private Placement Warrants were sold to Republic Sponsor
1 LLC, the Company’s sponsor, and 2,640,000 Private Placement Warrants were sold to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., the representative
of the underwriters in the IPO, in each case at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to
the Company of $7,280,000.
A total of $300,000,000, or
$10.00 per Unit, comprised of the net proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes the underwriter’s deferred discount of $12,000,000)
and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, acting as trustee.
An audited balance sheet as
of May 2, 2025 reflecting the receipt of the proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement has been issued by the Company and is included
as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K."

under “For Stockholders” in the “Resources” section. References herein to “we,” “us” or “our” refer to the Company and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.
BREIT Q1 2025 Update
BREIT is off to a strong start in 2025 amidst tremendous volatility and declines in the public markets. Healthy cash flow growth powered a +1.9% net return in Q1 (Class I), our best quarter since Q3’23.
1,3*
Private real estate outperformance through periods of volatility isn’t new. In fact, in the eight years of negative returns for the S&P 500 since 1980, seven were positive for private real estate. Two of those years were since BREIT’s inception (2018 and 2022), and in both of those years, BREIT returned +8%.
4
We believe this is why you want to be invested in BREIT across market cycles: BREIT is a diversifying source of return in portfolios.
Since inception over eight years ago, BREIT has generated a +9.4% annualized net return (Class I), ~65% higher than publicly traded REITs and ~3x private real estate, as well as consistent historical monthly distributions with potential tax benefits.
1,2
In 2024, 96% of BREIT’s distribution was classified as return of capital, bringing our 4.8% pre-tax Class I distribution rate to 7.5% on a tax-equivalent basis.
5,6**
BREIT in Today’s Investment Environment
Against a backdrop of global macro uncertainty driven by recent tariff announcements, we believe investors want to own hard assets in the right sectors and markets at a discount to physical replacement cost.
7
Unlike the public markets, BREIT’s performance is primarily driven by underlying real estate fundamentals and cash flow growth, not public market forces like sentiment or geopolitical uncertainty.
While the recovery has not been V-shaped, we believe the pillars of the real estate recovery remain intact despite the challenges in the broader investment environment today. Unlike other asset classes, we believe real estate values have already reset over the past few years and the recovery is just getting started, with values up only 5% from the 2023 trough.
8
We believe private real estate offers compelling relative value today, particularly when compared to the S&P 500 and corporate bonds, which earlier this year peaked at 78% and 31%, respectively, above their 2022 lows.
9
Importantly, we continue to see healthy supply-demand fundamentals drive resilient cash flow growth.
3*
BREIT’s portfolio is concentrated in sectors with powerful secular demand tailwinds that we expect will generate growth in excess of GDP.
10
We have strategically invested in areas where structural shifts – like U.S. reindustrialization, Sunbelt migration and the rise of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and cloud computing – are transforming where people live, how they shop and how they use technology and real estate. The supply backdrop in our key sectors is equally favorable, with multifamily and industrial supply down two-thirds from 2022 levels to ten-year lows.
11,12
The cost to build an industrial asset has doubled over the last several years, and we believe that tariffs will drive these replacement costs even higher and further constrain new supply.
7
All of this is very supportive of BREIT’s existing real estate asset values.
Despite this more uncertain macro environment, capital markets remain open which is a critical driver of the broader real estate recovery. Although we have seen some widening in spreads and base rate volatility since the tariff announcements, the cost of capital remains 15% lower than a year ago and 40% lower than the 2023 peak.
13
We also continue to see strong lending appetite from banks who are generally underallocated to real estate.
14
Finally, although tariff announcements have created noise around inflation, inflation has already come down significantly in recent years, with the March inflation print at the lowest level since 2021.
15
While goods inflation could accelerate, we believe this will likely be transitory and further declines in other components of the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) like energy, services and shelter costs should mitigate the overall inflationary impact of tariffs. However, in the event we see higher inflation, real estate has historically served as an effective hedge.
16
Portfolio in a Position of Strength
BREIT’s portfolio of Blackstone Real Estate’s best ideas is ~90% concentrated in rental housing, industrial and data centers and ~70% concentrated in fast-growing Sunbelt markets.
17
Our conviction in these sectors and markets is underpinned by secular megatrends that we believe will continue to generate growth in excess of GDP.
10
In a risk-off world, we believe rental housing is the kind of asset class you want to own. Demand for rental housing has been durable across market cycles because people always need a place to live, with U.S. multifamily occupancy averaging ~95% over the long term.
18
We have also seen strong in-migration trends in BREIT’s Sunbelt markets drive healthy apartment demand. While we did see excess construction in the Sunbelt moderate multifamily rent growth in recent years, ~80% of BREIT’s multifamily markets are now at or past peak supply and new deliveries will continue to decline sharply over the next year.
19
This will only exacerbate the existing 4-5M home shortfall in the U.S., which combined with the fact that it is ~50% more expensive to own vs. rent, all sets up a very favorable outlook.
20,21
BREIT’s industrial portfolio continues to be powered by long-term tailwinds including the need for faster e-commerce deliveries and the reindustrialization of U.S. manufacturing, both of which generate significant local demand for infill warehouses. Since 2021, chip manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and electric vehicle companies have announced $700B in U.S. manufacturing investments, driving an estimated 3-5x increase in spillover warehouse demand from their supply chain.
22,23
BREIT is well-positioned to capture this because our portfolio is concentrated in top-performing markets in hotspots for reindustrialization such as Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas. BREIT also has limited exposure to coastal markets that may be more impacted by tariff-related disruptions. This resilient demand backdrop and collapsing new supply should generate continued cash flow growth, particularly as market rents are on average 22% above BREIT’s in-place rents.
24
Data centers continue to benefit from a once-in-a-generation explosion in demand from the rise of AI and migration to the cloud. The largest hyperscalers have increased their data center capital expenditures by 3x since 2022 and continue to reaffirm their commitment to investing in digital infrastructure as they grow their cloud businesses and increase their AI deployments.
25
Since Blackstone acquired our data center platform, QTS, in 2021, QTS’ leased capacity has grown by 9x and today is the largest data center company in the world.
26
QTS is also the most active developer in the U.S. with a $25B+ development pipeline that is 100% pre-leased to investment-grade tenants with 15+ year leases.
27***
In addition, QTS owns land with access to critical power that could support another $80B+ of construction.
27***
Amidst the recent tariff announcements, QTS remains well-positioned as 90% of its total costs, including materials, equipment and labor, are domestically sourced with no direct exposure to tariffs. In addition to proactive supply chain management, QTS’ credibility with customers, significant land bank, access to power and scale capital position QTS particularly well to deliver in today’s dynamic environment.
These healthy fundamentals across our key sectors are driving BREIT’s estimated 4% cash flow growth in the first quarter.
3
In addition, another driver of cash flow growth and ultimately long-term performance for BREIT is our embedded growth potential. Market rents in our portfolio are on average 12% above BREIT's in-place rents today, which we expect to capture as leases expire over the next few years even without further market rent growth.
28
We believe now is the time to be invested in BREIT and we are excited to build on our momentum so far in 2025. As we look ahead, we believe BREIT is exceptionally well-positioned to deliver diversification, stability and strong long-term performance. We remain grateful for your partnership and trust.

Preliminary Estimated Same Property NOI Growth.
Represents BREIT’s year-to-date preliminary estimated same property NOI growth for the three months ended March 31, 2025 (compared to the prior year based on the midpoint of the preliminary estimated range of same property NOI). This data is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and our actual results may differ materially from this preliminary estimated data. Net Operating Income (“NOI”) is a supplemental non-GAAP measure of our property operating results that we believe is meaningful because it enables management to evaluate the impact of occupancy, rents, leasing activity and other controllable property operating results at our real estate. We define NOI as operating revenues less operating expenses, which exclude (i) impairment of investments in real estate, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) straight-line rental income and expense, (iv) amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles, (v) amortization of accumulated unrealized gains on derivatives previously recognized in other comprehensive income, (vi) lease termination fees, (vii) property expenses not core to the operations of such properties, (viii) other non-property-related revenue and expense items such as (a) general and administrative expenses, (b) management fee paid to the Adviser, (c) performance participation allocation paid to the Special Limited Partner, (d) incentive compensation awards, (e) income (loss) from investments in real estate debt, (f) change in net assets of consolidated securitization vehicles, (g) income (loss) from interest rate derivatives, (h) net gain on dispositions of real estate, (i) interest expense, net, (j) loss on extinguishment of debt, (k) other income (expense), and (ix) similar adjustments for NOI attributable to non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. We evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-property basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same property if they were owned for the full periods presented, otherwise they are considered non-same property. Recently developed properties are not included in same property results until the properties have achieved stabilization for both full periods presented. We define stabilization for the property as the earlier of (i) achieving 90% occupancy, (ii) 12 months after receiving a certificate of occupancy, or (iii) for Data Centers 12 months after receiving a certificate of occupancy and greater than 50% of its critical IT capacity has been built. Certain assets are excluded from same property results and are considered non-same property, including (i) properties held-for-sale, (ii) properties that are being redeveloped, (iii) properties identified for future sale, and (iv) interests in unconsolidated entities under contract for sale with hard deposit or other factors ensuring the buyer’s performance. We do not consider our investments in the real estate debt segment or equity securities to be same property. For more information, please refer to BREIT’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2025 and the prospectus. Additionally, please refer above for a reconciliation of preliminary estimated GAAP loss to preliminary estimated same property NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Tax Information.
The tax information herein is provided for informational purposes only, is subject to material change, and should not be relied upon as a guarantee or prediction of tax effects. This material also does not constitute tax advice to, and should not be relied upon by, potential investors, who should consult their own tax advisors regarding the matters discussed herein and the tax consequences of an investment. A portion of REIT ordinary income distributions may be tax deferred given the ability to characterize ordinary income as Return of Capital (“ROC”). ROC distributions reduce the stockholder’s tax basis in the
year the distribution is received, and generally defer taxes on that portion until the stockholder’s stock is sold via redemption. Upon redemption, the investor may be subject to higher capital gains taxes as a result of a lower cost basis due to the ROC distributions. Certain non-cash deductions, such as depreciation and amortization, lower the taxable income for REIT distributions. Investors should be aware that a REIT’s ROC percentage may vary significantly in a given year and, as a result, the impact of the tax law and any related advantage may vary significantly from year to year. At this time, the 20% rate deduction to individual tax rates on the ordinary income portion of distributions is set to expire on December 31, 2025. The tax benefits are not applicable to capital gain dividends or certain qualified dividend income and are only available for qualified REITs. If BREIT did not qualify as a REIT, the tax benefit would be unavailable. BREIT’s board also has the authority to revoke its REIT election. There may be adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes and other investments may offer tax advantages without the set expiration. An accelerated depreciation schedule does not guarantee a profitable return on investment and ROC reduces the basis of the investment. While we currently believe that the estimations and assumptions referenced herein are reasonable under the circumstances, there is no guarantee that the conditions upon which such assumptions are based will materialize or are otherwise applicable. This information does not constitute a forecast, and all assumptions herein are subject to uncertainties, changes and other risks, any of which may cause the relevant actual, financial and other results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the information presented herein. No assurance, representation or warranty is made by any person that any of the estimations herein will be achieved, and no recipient of this example should rely on such estimations. Investors may also be subject to net investment income taxes of 3.8% and/or state income tax in their state of residence which would lower the after-tax distribution rate received by the investor.
Third Party Information.
Certain information contained in this material has been obtained from sources outside Blackstone, which in certain cases have not been updated through the date hereof. While such information is believed to be reliable for purposes used herein, no representations are made as to the accuracy or completeness thereof and none of Blackstone, its funds, nor any of their affiliates takes any responsibility for, and has not independently verified, any such information.

Trends.
There can be no assurances that any of the trends described herein will continue or will not reverse. Past events and trends do not imply, predict or guarantee, and are not necessarily indicative of, future events or results.
Use of Leverage.
BREIT uses and expects to continue to use leverage. If returns on such investment exceed the costs of borrowing, investor returns will be enhanced. However, if returns do not exceed the costs of borrowing, BREIT performance will be depressed. This includes the potential for BREIT to suffer greater losses than it otherwise would have. The effect of leverage is that any losses will be magnified. The use of leverage involves a high degree of financial risk and will increase BREIT's exposure to adverse economic factors such as rising interest rates, downturns in the economy or deteriorations in the condition of BREIT's investments. This leverage may also subject BREIT and its investments to restrictive financial and operating covenants, which may limit flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. For example, leveraged entities may be subject to restrictions on making interest payments and other distributions.
*Cash flow growth refers to same property net operating income (“NOI”) growth. Reflects BREIT’s year-over-year preliminary estimated same property NOI growth for the three months ended March 31, 2025. See “Important Disclosure Information–Preliminary Estimated Same Property NOI Growth”.
**Assumes that the investment in BREIT shares is not sold or redeemed. The tax-equivalent distribution rate would be up to 1.4% lower taking into account deferred capital gains tax that would be payable upon redemption. See notes 5 and 6 for more information.
***Reflects QTS’ development pipeline at 100% ownership interest. As of March 31, 2025, BREIT’s ownership interest in QTS was 35% and the QTS investment accounted for 14.6% of BREIT’s real estate asset value.

Represents BREIT Class I shares. Returns shown reflect the percent change in the NAV per share from the beginning of the applicable period, plus the amount of any distribution per share declared in the period.
All returns shown assume reinvestment of distributions pursuant to BREIT’s distribution reinvestment plan, are derived from unaudited financial information, and are net of all BREIT expenses, including general and administrative expenses, transaction related expenses, management fees, performance participation allocation, and share class-specific fees, but exclude the impact of early repurchase deductions on the repurchase of shares that have been outstanding for less than one year.
The inception dates for the Class I, D, S and T shares are January 1, 2017, May 1, 2017, January 1, 2017 and June 1, 2017, respectively. The returns have been prepared using unaudited data and valuations of the underlying investments in BREIT’s portfolio, which are estimates of fair value and form the basis for BREIT’s NAV. Valuations based upon unaudited reports from the underlying investments may be subject to later adjustments, may not correspond to realized value and may not accurately reflect the price at which assets could be liquidated. As return information is calculated based on NAV, return information presented will be impacted should the assumptions on which NAV was determined prove to be different.
Past performance does not predict future returns.
The Q1’25 figures for BREIT, S&P 500, Publicly Traded REIT’s and Corporate Bonds was 1.9%,  -4.3%, 1.1% and
1.0%, respectively. 3-Year returns are annualized consistent with the IPA Practice Guideline 2018. Please see www.breit.com/performance for information on BREIT returns.
2
Publicly traded REITs reflect the MSCI US REIT Index total return as of March 31, 2025. BREIT’s Class I inception date is January 1, 2017. Private real estate reflects the net total return as of March 31, 2025, which is the latest data available.
During the period from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2025, BREIT Class I’s annualized total net return of 9.4% was 2.7x the NFI-ODCE annualized total net return of 3.5% and ~65% higher than the MSCI US REIT Index annualized total return of 5.7%.
S&P 500 reflects total return. Corporate bonds reflect the total return of the ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index. BREIT does not trade on a national securities exchange, and therefore, is generally illiquid. The volatility and risk profile of the indices presented are likely to be materially different from that of BREIT including that BREIT's fees and expenses may be higher and BREIT shares are significantly less liquid than publicly traded companies. See “Important Disclosure Information–Index Definitions.”3
Cash flow growth refers to same property net operating income (“NOI”) growth. Reflects BREIT’s year-over-year preliminary estimated same property NOI growth for the year to date period ended March 31, 2025 (based on the midpoint of the preliminary estimated range of same property NOI). See “Important Disclosure Information–Preliminary Estimated Same Property NOI Growth.”4
Morningstar Direct, NCREIF, as of December 31, 2024. BREIT does not trade on a national securities exchange, and therefore, is generally illiquid. The volatility and risk profile of the indices presented are likely to be materially different from that of BREIT including that BREIT’s fees and expenses may be higher and BREIT shares are significantly less liquid than publicly traded companies. There can be no assurance that any Blackstone fund or investment will be able to implement its investment strategy, achieve its objectives or avoid substantial losses. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Reflects annual gross total returns and represents the 8 calendar-year periods since 1980 when the S&P 500 generated a negative return. Private real estate reflects the NFI-ODCE index, which reflects total returns of various private real estate funds and should not be considered reflective of the performance of BREIT. Indices are meant to illustrate general market performance. Since 1980 the S&P 500 has returned, on average, +13% returns while private real estate returned, on average, +8% returns. Comparisons shown are for informational purposes only, do not represent specific investments and are not a portfolio allocation recommendation. Over the last 20 years, (2005-2024), the S&P 500 and NFI-ODCE index have had a 0.0 correlation. 2 of the 8 years occurred after BREIT’s inception, 2018 and 2022. In 2018, the S&P 500 generated a -4.4% return and private real estate generated a 8.3% return. In 2022, the S&P 500 generated a -18.1% return and private real estate generated a 7.5% return. BREIT Class I returned 8.3% in 2018 and 8.4% in 2022. Please see www.breit.com/performance for information on BREIT returns. See “Important Disclosure Information–Index Definitions” and “–Trends.”5
Reflects the current month’s Class I distribution annualized and divided by the prior month’s net asset value, which is inclusive of all fees and expenses. Annualized distribution rate for the other share classes: Class D: 4.7%, Class S: 3.9% and Class T: 4.0%. Distributions are not guaranteed and may be funded from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, borrowings, the sale of our assets, repayments of our real estate debt investments, ROC or offering proceeds, and advances or the deferral of fees and expenses. We have no limits on the amounts we may fund from such sources. Our inception to date cash flows from operating activities, along with net gains from investment realizations, have funded 100% of our distributions through December 31, 2024. See ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities -Distributions"" on BREIT's Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. A portion of REIT ordinary income distributions may be tax deferred given the ability to characterize ordinary income as ROC. ROC distributions reduce the stockholder’s tax basis in the year the distribution is received, and generally defer taxes on that portion until the stockholder’s stock is sold via redemption. Upon redemption, the investor may be subject to higher capital gains taxes as a result of a lower cost basis due to the ROC distributions. Certain non-cash deductions, such as depreciation and amortization, lower the taxable income for REIT distributions. BREIT’s ROC in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 was 66%, 97%, 90%, 100%, 92%, 94%, 85% and 96%, respectively. See “Important Disclosure Information” including “Tax Information.”6
7.5% tax-equivalent distribution rate assumes that the investment in BREIT shares is not sold or redeemed and reflects the pre-tax distribution rate an investor would need to receive from a theoretical investment to match the 4.8% after-tax distribution rate earned by a BREIT Class I stockholder based on BREIT’s 2024 ROC of 96%, if the distributions from the theoretical investment (i) were classified as ordinary income subject to tax at the top marginal tax rate of 37%, (ii) did not benefit from the 20% tax rate deduction and (iii) were not classified as ROC. The ordinary income tax rate could change in the future. Tax-equivalent distribution rate for the other share classes are as follows: Class D: 7.3%; Class S: 6.2%; and Class T: 6.3%. The tax-equivalent distribution rate would be reduced by 1.4%, 1.4%, 1.2% and 1.2% for Class I, D, S and T shares, respectively, taking into account deferred capital gains tax that would be payable upon redemption. This assumes a one-year holding period and includes the impact of deferred capital gains tax incurred in connection with a redemption of BREIT shares. Upon redemption, an investor is assumed to be subject to tax on all prior ROC
distributions at the current maximum capital gains rate of 20%. The capital gains rate could change in the future. At this time, the 20% rate deduction to individual tax rates on the ordinary income portion of distributions is set to expire on December 31, 2025. See “Important Disclosure Information–Tax Information” for more information.

There is no assurance that any Blackstone fund or strategy will effectively hedge inflation. Inflation hedge refers to growth in real estate net operating income (“NOI”) generally outpacing inflation. NOI reflects Green Street Advisors data, as of December 31, 2024. 2024 NOI growth represents year-end estimate as of February 5, 2025. U.S. CPI reflects Bureau of Labor Statistics data, as of December 31, 2024. NOI growth represents the average NOI growth by year across the equal-weighted average of the asset-weighted average of the multifamily, industrial, mall, office and shopping center sectors. Multifamily refers to apartments; shopping center refers to strip retail. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services. NOI may not be correlated to or continue to keep pace with inflation. See “Important Disclosure Information–Trends.”17“Property Sector” weighting is measured as the asset value of real estate investments for each sector category divided by the asset value of all of BREIT’s real estate investments, excluding the value of any third-party interests in such real estate investments. Rental housing includes the following subsectors: multifamily (21%, including senior housing, which accounts for <1%), student housing (9%), single family rental housing (9%, including manufactured housing, which accounts for 1%) and affordable housing (8%). Please see the prospectus for more information on BREIT’s investments.“Region Concentration” represents regions as defined by the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (“NCREIF”) and the weighting is measured as the asset value of real estate properties for each regional category divided by the asset value of all of BREIT’s real estate properties, excluding the value of any third-party interests in such real estate properties. “Sunbelt” reflects the South and West regions of the U.S. as defined by NCREIF. “Non-U.S.” reflects investments in Europe and Canada.

A number of factors, including operating expenses as described in “Important Disclosure Information– Preliminary Estimated Same Property NOI Growth”, will impact BREIT’s net performance or returns. Any expectations that in-place rents have the potential to increase are based on certain assumptions that may not be correct and on certain variables that may change.
Index Definitions
An investment in BREIT is not a direct investment in real estate, and has material differences from a direct investment in real estate, including those related to fees and expenses, liquidity and tax treatment. BREIT’s share price is subject to less volatility because its per share NAV is based on the value of real estate assets it owns and is not subject to market pricing forces as are the prices of the asset classes represented by the indices presented. Although BREIT’s share price is subject to less volatility, BREIT shares are significantly less liquid than these asset classes, and are not immune to fluctuations. Private real estate is not traded on an exchange and will have less liquidity and price transparency. The value of private real estate may fluctuate and may be worth less than was initially paid for it.
The volatility and risk profile of the indices presented is likely to be materially different from that of BREIT including those related to fees and expenses, liquidity, safety, and tax features. In addition, the indices employ different investment guidelines and criteria than BREIT; as a result, the holdings in BREIT may differ significantly from the holdings of the securities that comprise the indices. The indices are not subject to fees or expenses, are meant to illustrate general market performance and it may not be possible to invest in the indices. The performance of the indices has not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark to compare to BREIT’s performance, but rather is disclosed to allow for comparison of BREIT’s performance to that of well-known and widely recognized indices. A summary of the investment guidelines for the indices presented is available upon request. In the case of equity indices, performance of the indices reflects the reinvestment of dividends.
BREIT does not trade on a national securities exchange, and therefore, is generally illiquid. Your ability to redeem shares in BREIT through BREIT’s share repurchase plan may be limited, and fees associated with the sale of these products can be higher than other asset classes. In some cases, periodic distributions may be subsidized by borrowed funds and include a return of investor principal. This is in contrast to the distributions investors receive from large corporate stocks that trade on national exchanges, which are typically derived solely from earnings. Investors typically seek income from distributions over a period of years. Upon liquidation, ROC may be more or less than the original investment depending on the value of assets.
An investment in BREIT (i) differs from the Green Street Commercial Property Price Index in that such index represents various private real estate values with differing sector concentrations (ii) differs from high yield bonds and the ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index in that private real estate investments are not fixed-rate debt instruments and such bonds represent debt issued by corporations across a variety of issuers with varying pricing, terms and conditions, (iii) differs from the MSCI U.S. REIT Index in that BREIT is not a publicly traded U.S. Equity REIT, (iv) differs from the NFI-ODCE in that such index represents various private real estate funds with differing terms and strategies, and (v) differs from equities and the S&P 500 Index in that private real estate investments are not large or mid cap stocks and are not publicly traded.
The Green Street Commercial Property Price Index (“CPPI”) is a value-weighted time series of unleveraged U.S. commercial property values with an inception date of December 31, 1997. CPPI is shown to illustrate general market trends for informational purposes only, does not represent any specific investment and does not reflect how BREIT has performed or will perform in the future. The index captures the prices at which commercial real estate transactions are currently being negotiated and contracted, measuring price changes across select property types covered by Green Street Advisors. All Property Sector weights: retail (20%), apartments (15%), health care (15%), industrial (12.5%), office (12.5%), lodging (7.5%), data center (5%), net lease (5%), self-storage (5%), and manufactured home park (2.5%). Apartments refers to multifamily, lodging refers to hospitality.
The ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index is a capitalization-weighted index that measures the performance of USD-denominated, below investment grade rated, fixed rate corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. An investment in high-yield corporate bonds is generally considered to be a less risky investment than private real estate.
The MSCI U.S. REIT Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is comprised of equity REITs. The index is based on the MSCI USA Investable Market Index (IMI), its parent index, which captures large, mid and small cap securities. It represents about 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. The index is calculated with dividends reinvested on a daily basis.
The NFI-ODCE is a capitalization-weighted, gross of fees, time-weighted return index with an inception date of December 31, 1977. Published reports also contain equal-weighted and net of fees information. Open-end funds are generally defined as infinite-life vehicles consisting of multiple investors who have the ability to enter or exit the fund on a periodic basis, subject to contribution and/or redemption requests, thereby providing a degree of potential investment liquidity. The term diversified core equity typically reflects lower risk investment strategies utilizing low leverage and is generally represented by equity ownership positions in stable U.S. operating properties diversified across regions and property types. While funds used in the NFI-ODCE have characteristics that differ from BREIT (including differing management fees and leverage), BREIT’s management feels that the NFI-ODCE is an appropriate and accepted index for the purpose of evaluating the total returns of direct real estate funds. Comparisons shown are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent specific investments. Investors cannot invest in this index. BREIT has the ability to utilize higher leverage than is allowed for the funds in the NFI-ODCE, which could increase BREIT’s volatility relative to the index. Additionally, an investment in BREIT is subject to certain fees that are not contemplated in the NFI-ODCE.
The S&P 500 Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that includes 500 stocks representing all major industries. Returns are denominated in U.S. dollars. The S&P 500 Index is a proxy of the performance of the broad U.S. economy through changes in aggregate market value. The S&P 500 Index is a widely used barometer of U.S. stock market performance. The key risk of the S&P 500 Index is the volatility that comes with exposure to the stock market.
