Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement
On May 7, 2025, Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) entered into a Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the syndication agents and documentation agents named therein in such capacity and as the initial lenders.
The Term Loan Agreement provides for a delayed draw term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of up to $6.0 billion comprised of two tranches: (i) commitments to provide loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.0 billion (“Tranche
A-1”) and (ii) commitments to provide loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.0 billion (“Tranche
A-2,” and, together with Tranche
A-1,
the “Tranches”). Commitments to provide Tranche
A-1
will expire on May 30, 2025 and commitments to provide Tranche
A-2
will expire on December 19, 2025.
Honeywell has elected to enter into the Term Loan Agreement to provide financial flexibility as it manages the separation of its Automation, Aerospace and Solstice Advanced Materials businesses into three independent public companies, while continuing to execute on its capital deployment plan. The Term Loan Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes, including as noted immediately above.
Interest rates on the term loans under each Tranche will be based on prevailing market rates, plus a margin, in addition to a ticking fee payable on unused amounts, as further described in the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement does not restrict Honeywell’s ability to pay dividends, nor does it contain financial covenants. The Term Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for investment grade borrowers and financings of this type.
The foregoing description of the Term Loan Agreement is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Term Loan Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Credit Agreement
On May 8, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), Autodesk, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”), and Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), as administrative agent, which provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1,500,000,000. As of the Effective Date, the Company had no outstanding revolving loans under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, the Company terminated its existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2021, as amended, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent.
The Credit Agreement permits the Company to increase the commitments for revolving loans thereunder from time to time, but in any case no more than twice per calendar year, up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000,000. Each such increase is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from the lenders then party to the Credit Agreement or new lenders.
The proceeds of the revolving loans under the Credit Agreement may be used by the Company for working capital and general corporate purposes.
Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed, without premium or penalty (subject to customary breakage costs), until the termination date under the Credit Agreement, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The scheduled termination date under the Credit Agreement is May 8, 2030, which termination date may be extended with respect to some or all of the commitments under the Credit Agreement subject to certain terms and conditions, including the consent of each Lender holding commitments to be extended.
Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (i) a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate (as defined below), or (ii) a term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), plus a margin of between 0.575% and 1.000%, depending on the Company’s Public Debt Rating (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Interest is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to borrowings bearing interest at the Base Rate or on the last day of an interest period, but at least every three months, with respect to borrowings bearing interest at a SOFR rate.
In the Credit Agreement, “Base Rate” means a floating rate per annum equal to the greatest of (A) Citibank’s base lending rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus 0.500% and (C) Term SOFR for a one-month tenor plus 1.00%. A default interest rate shall apply on all obligations during a payment or bankruptcy event of default under the Credit Agreement at a rate per annum equal to 2.000% above the applicable interest rate.
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company will pay to each Lender a facility fee on a quarterly basis based on amounts committed (whether used or unused) under the revolving facility of between 0.050% and 0.125% per annum, depending on the Company’s Public Debt Rating. The Company is also obligated under the Credit Agreement to pay agent fees customary for a credit facility of this size and type.
The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of Consolidated Covenant Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) no greater than 3.50:1.00 during the term of the credit facility, subject to adjustment following the consummation of certain acquisitions up to 4.00:1.00 for up to four consecutive fiscal quarters ending after the consummation of such acquisitions, subject to certain other limitations as set forth in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, materially change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type.
The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that include, among other things, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, change of control and certain material ERISA events, in each case, subject to thresholds and cure periods as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Lenders may terminate their commitments and accelerate the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement and may exercise certain other rights and remedies provided for under the Credit Agreement and applicable law.
Citibank, the Lenders, and certain of their respective affiliates have provided, and in the future may provide, financial, banking and related services to the Company. These parties have received, and in the future may receive, compensation from the Company for these services.
The Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. The above description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.

On May 8, 2025, Coinbase Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Coinbase”), Sentillia B.V., a private limited liability company organized under the laws of the Netherlands (“Deribit”), the Deribit shareholders listed on Exhibit B thereto (the “Deribit Shareholders”) and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the shareholders’ agent (“Shareholders’ Agent”), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement and Share Purchase (as defined below) have been approved by the respective boards of directors or equivalent governing bodies of Coinbase and Deribit.
The Purchase Agreement provides that, on the date of closing of the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the “Closing”), and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Coinbase or its affiliate will acquire, from the Deribit Shareholders, all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Deribit (the “Share Purchase”). As consideration for the Share Purchase, Coinbase will (i) pay the Deribit Shareholders an aggregate of $700 million in cash; and (ii) issue to the Deribit Shareholders an aggregate of 10,997,881 shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 (“Coinbase Stock”), subject to (a) customary adjustments for net working capital, unpaid indebtedness, unpaid transaction expenses and the amount of unrestricted cash held by Deribit, (b) an amount to be held in escrow for 15 months with respect to the indemnification obligations of the Deribit Shareholders as set forth in the Purchase Agreement and (c) amounts to be withheld with respect to a purchase price adjustment escrow and an expense fund for the Shareholders’ Agent.
The obligation of the parties to consummate the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of customary conditions, including: (i) receipt of certain regulatory approvals; (ii) the absence of laws or orders restraining or preventing the consummation of the Share Purchase; (iii) the representations and warranties of Coinbase, Deribit and the Deribit Shareholders being true and correct, subject to the materiality standards contained in the Purchase Agreement, and Coinbase, Deribit and the Deribit Shareholders having complied in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Purchase Agreement; (iv) the absence of any effects that have constituted or resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to constitute or result in, a material adverse effect for Coinbase or Deribit; and (v) the receipt by Coinbase and Deribit of certain closing agreements and certificates. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties given by Coinbase, Deribit and the Deribit Shareholders. Coinbase, Deribit and the Deribit Shareholders have also each made customary covenants in the Purchase Agreement, including covenants by Deribit relating to the conduct of its business prior to the Closing. The Purchase Agreement contains customary termination rights for Coinbase and Deribit, including if the Share Purchase is not completed by November 8, 2025 (subject to extension rights to the extent certain regulatory approvals remain outstanding) (the “Outside Date”). Under the Purchase Agreement, Coinbase will be required to pay a termination fee to Deribit equal to $100 million if the Purchase Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals prior to the Outside Date. The parties have agreed to use their respective reasonable efforts to complete the Share Purchase, including to obtain certain specified regulatory approvals for the transaction.
Coinbase intends to issue the shares of Coinbase Stock at Closing as part of the consideration for the transaction proposed by the Purchase Agreement in reliance upon the exemptions from registration afforded by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Coinbase has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-3 as promptly as practicable following the Closing covering the resale of such shares of Coinbase Stock. In connection with the Share Purchase, certain Deribit Shareholders, who will receive more than 75% of the Coinbase Stock issued in connection with the Share Purchase in the aggregate, have agreed to enter into a lock-up arrangement to place restrictions on the transfer of two-thirds of the shares of Coinbase Stock received by such Deribit Shareholders, with 50% of such shares released from the lock-up 90 days following the Closing and the remaining 50% of such shares released from the lock-up 180 days following the Closing.
The foregoing description of the Share Purchase and the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any factual information about the parties.
The Purchase Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, which were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specified dates. In particular, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in the Purchase Agreement may be subject to limitations agreed by the parties, including having been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made between the parties in connection with the negotiation of the Purchase Agreement, and having been made for purposes of allocating risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. In addition, the parties may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Purchase Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in parties’ public disclosures. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the parties.

Forward-Looking Statement Disclosure
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding Coinbase’s anticipated closing of the Share Purchase. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “plan,” “target,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations, assumptions, and projections based on information available at the time the statements were made. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among others: failure to obtain applicable regulatory approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the transaction or to complete the transaction on anticipated terms and timing; negative effects of the announcement of the transaction; risks that the businesses will not be integrated successfully on a timely basis or at all, or that Coinbase will not realize expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and/or growth, or that such benefits may take longer to realize than expected; the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm business plans and operations; significant transaction and integration costs; the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the
transaction on Coinbase’s, Deribit’s or the combined company’s relationships with partners, customers, employees and regulators; demand for Coinbase’s, Deribit’s, or the combined company’s products and services; market acceptance of Coinbase’s products and services; Coinbase’s ability to expand internationally; the effects of increased competition in Coinbase’s markets; Coinbase’s ability to stay in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; stock price fluctuations; market conditions across the cryptoeconomy, including crypto asset price volatility; and general market, political, and economic conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, inflation, instability in the global banking system, economic downturns, and other global events, including regional wars and conflicts, tariffs and government shutdowns. It is not possible for Coinbase’s management to predict all risks, nor can Coinbase assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements Coinbase may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, Coinbase’s actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from forecasted results are, or will be included, in the filings Coinbase makes with the SEC from time to time, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on February 13, 2025. Except as required by law, Coinbase assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements."

Regulation FD Disclosure.
Credit Agreement Amendment
The Company has launched a proposed refinancing of its Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among the Company, the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and bookrunner, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent dated as of August 19, 2021 (as amended, the “Existing Credit Agreement”) with a new $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in 2030 (the “New Revolver”). The Company anticipates that the New Revolver will be documented by amending and restating (such Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the “Amended Credit Agreement”) the Existing Credit Agreement. The Company currently intends to use the proceeds from the Notes Offering (as defined below) to, among other things, repay certain outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement.
The proposed Amended Credit Agreement will refinance the Existing Credit Agreement with the previously referenced New Revolver, which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt (including under the Existing Credit Agreement), acquisitions, and the repurchase of our common stock. Interest rates on amounts borrowed under the proposed New Revolver are anticipated to be based on (i) an adjusted base rate, which is the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (c) Daily Simple SOFR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, (ii) Daily Simple SOFR plus an applicable margin (or, if such rate is no longer available, a successor benchmark rate to be determined in accordance with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement), or (iii) term SOFR (without a credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin (or, if such rate is no longer available, a successor benchmark rate to be determined in accordance with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement). The applicable margin for base rate borrowings and for SOFR borrowings are anticipated to be determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio. The applicable margin for base rate borrowings are anticipated to range from 0% to 0.75% per annum and for SOFR borrowings are anticipated to range from 1% to 1.75% per annum. The proposed New Revolver is anticipated to contain certain restrictive covenants that are substantially similar to those under the Existing Credit Agreement, but will not contain a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Amended Credit Agreement is anticipated to permit the Company to, subject to certain conditions, increase the New Revolver and/or borrow one or more incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (a) 100% of EBITDA for the most recently ended four consecutive fiscal quarter period for which financial statements have been delivered under the Amended Credit Agreement and (b) an amount which, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such increase (assuming such increase is funded on the effective date thereof and after giving effect to any permanent repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith) would not cause the consolidated leverage ratio to exceed a ratio of 0.50 to 1.00 below the applicable maximum consolidated leverage ratio then in effect under the Amended Credit Agreement.
The closing of the Amended Credit Agreement, which is anticipated to occur concurrently with the closing of the Notes Offering, is subject to market conditions, as well as the negotiation and execution of definitive documents and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The consummation of the Notes Offering is not conditioned on the Company obtaining the New Revolver or entering into the Amended Credit Agreement, and the Company can provide no assurances that the Company will be successful in obtaining the New Revolver or entering into the Amended Credit Agreement on the terms described above.

Kellogg Company in March 2012 as President, Asia Pacific, and his responsibilities were expanded to President, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa in July 2018. Before joining Kellogg Company, Mr. Banati served in a variety of finance, general
management and board roles at Kraft Foods, Cadbury Schweppes and Procter & Gamble. Mr. Banati currently serves on the board of directors of Fortune Brands Innovations.
In connection with Mr. Banati’s appointment, Mr. Banati and the Company executed an offer letter on May 5, 2025 (the “Offer Letter”). The Offer Letter provides for a base
salary of $900,000, eligibility for an annual bonus target of 110% of Mr. Banati’s base salary, annual equity award grants with an aggregate target value of $3.2 million, and that Mr. Banati will be an “Eligible Employee” for purposes of the
Executive Severance Pay Plan of Kenvue Inc. and U.S. Affiliated Companies (the “Severance Plan”). Mr. Banati’s 2025 equity grant will be granted at the target value and consist of the same types of awards, with the same vesting terms, as for
Kenvue’s other executive officers. Mr. Banati will be subject to the Company’s standard restrictive covenant agreement, which includes restrictions relating to non-competition, non-solicitation, and protection of confidential information.
The Company agreed to provide Mr. Banati with the following awards: (1) a cash bonus of $2,500,000, paid shortly after the Effective Date; (2) an award of RSUs with a
fair market value of $4,000,000, granted within two months of the Effective Date; (3) a cash bonus of $4,000,000, paid upon the closing of the merger transaction between Mars Inc. and Kellanova (the “Transaction”), if such closing occurs no later
than August 13, 2026 (the “Transaction Condition”); and (4) an award of RSUs with a fair market value of $2,500,000, granted within two months of the satisfaction of the Transaction Condition. The equity awards will vest over a three-year period
following the applicable grant date. The cash-based awards will generally be subject to 100% repayment if Mr. Banati terminates employment prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date and 50% repayment if Mr. Banati terminates employment
prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date.
The Offer Letter further provides that if Mr. Banati’s employment with Kenvue terminates (1) due to death or “disability”, (2) by Mr. Banati for “good reason” or (3) by
the Company other than for “significant  misconduct” (as such terms are defined in the Offer Letter), then: (i) any requirement to repay the cash sign-on awards will no longer apply; (ii) the equity sign-on awards will vest in full upon death or
disability and will otherwise be subject to continued vesting; and (iii) if the Transaction Condition is satisfied after such termination, Mr. Banati will receive any sign-on compensation that is subject to achievement of the Transaction Condition.
The foregoing description of the Offer Letter does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Offer Letter, a copy of which is
attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
There are no family relationships, as defined in Item 401 of Regulation S-K, between Mr. Banati and any of Kenvue’s executive officers or directors or persons nominated
or chosen by Kenvue to become a director or executive officer. There have been no transactions since the beginning of the Company’s last fiscal year, and there are no currently proposed transactions, in which the Company was or is to be a
participant and in which Mr. Banati, or any member of his immediate family, had or will have any interest, that are required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. There is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Banati and any
other person pursuant to which Mr. Banati was appointed as an officer of the Company.
On May 8, 2025, the Company also announced that Paul Ruh, currently Kenvue’s Chief Financial Officer, will cease to serve as Chief Financial Officer on the Effective
Date (the “CFO Transition”). Mr. Ruh will remain with the Company in a strategic advisor role through May 16, 2025, to assist with the transition of his duties. The CFO Transition, with respect to Mr. Ruh, meets the conditions of the separation
without “cause” provisions of the Severance Plan and Mr. Ruh’s long-term incentive awards. Accordingly, subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates and his continuing compliance with his restrictive
covenant obligations, Mr. Ruh will receive the severance payments and benefits payable under the Severance Plan and his long-term incentive awards will be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
6.750% Senior Notes due 2035
On May 8, 2025 (the “Closing Date”), Builders FirstSource, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), completed the previously announced sale of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.750% senior notes due 2035 (the “Notes”) at an issue price of 100.0% (the “Notes Offering”).
The Company used the net proceeds from the Notes Offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Company’s senior secured ABL facility (the “ABL Facility”).
The Notes were issued and sold in a private transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined in and in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to
non-U.S.
persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Notes and the related guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes and the related guarantees may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. This Current Report on Form
8-K
(this “Current Report”) is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes or any other securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
Indenture
The terms of the Notes are governed by the indenture, dated as of the Closing Date (the “Indenture”), among the Company, the guarantors named therein (the “Guarantors”) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).
Interest and Maturity
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.750% and mature on May 15, 2035. Interest is payable on the Notes on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2025.
Guarantees
The Notes, subject to certain exceptions, are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by each of the Company’s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”) that guarantee its obligations under the ABL Facility, the Company’s 5.000% senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), the Company’s 4.250% senior notes due 2032 (the “4.25% 2032 Notes”), the Company’s 6.375% senior notes due 2032 (the “6.375% 2032 Notes”) and the Company’s 6.375% senior notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes” and, collectively with the 2030 Notes, the 4.25% 2032 Notes and the 6.375% 2032 Notes, the “Existing Notes”). Subject to certain exceptions, future subsidiaries that guarantee the ABL Facility and the Existing Notes or certain other indebtedness will also guarantee the Notes.
Ranking
The Notes constitute senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the Guarantors and rank
pari passu
in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company, including indebtedness under the ABL Facility and the Existing Notes, effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantors (including indebtedness under the ABL Facility) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, senior to all of the future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantors and structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred stock, of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.
Covenants
The Indenture contains restrictive covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue preferred stock, create liens, create restrictions on the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to make payments to the Company, pay dividends and make other distributions in respect of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ capital stock, make certain investments or certain other restricted payments, guarantee indebtedness, designate unrestricted subsidiaries, sell certain kinds of assets, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, and effect mergers and consolidations.
Certain of these covenants will be suspended if the Notes are assigned an investment grade rating by any two of Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.
Events of Default
The Indenture provides for events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include, among others, nonpayment of principal or interest when due, breach of covenants or other agreements in the Indenture, defaults in payment of certain other indebtedness and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and unpaid interest on all of the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
Redemption
At any time prior to May 15, 2030, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus the “applicable premium” set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or after May 15, 2030, the Company may redeem the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time prior to May 15, 2028, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, as described in the Indenture, at a price equal to 106.750% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company experiences certain change of control triggering events, holders of the Notes may require it to repurchase all or part of their Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
The foregoing summaries of the Indenture and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual Indenture and form of the Notes, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and incorporated by reference herein.

Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward-looking, including without limitation statements regarding our financial outlook and succession planning. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “toward,” “will,” or “would,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may cause actual results or outcomes to be materially different from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors include the risks described from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the Commission on February 28, 2025. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The Company has based these forward-looking statements primarily on information available to it as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K and its current expectations and projections about future events and trends that it believes may affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. While the Company believes such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. The Company’s statements should not be read to indicate that it has conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks may emerge from time to time. It is not possible for the Company to predict all risks, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements it may make. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation, and does not intend, to update these forward-looking statements."

On May 8, 2025, Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The information in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, is being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 (the “Section”) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 8, 2025, the Company announced plans to implement a holding company reorganization (the “Holding Company Reorganization”), currently planned to become effective by June 1, 2025, by executing a tax-free merger of the Company with and into Rocket Lab Merger Sub, Inc., a newly formed Delaware corporation that is a subsidiary of a newly formed Delaware corporation, Rocket Lab Corporation (“Rocket Lab Corporation”). Upon the effectiveness of the Holding Company Reorganization, Rocket Lab Corporation would become the successor issuer to the Company, a Delaware corporation.
The Company anticipates multiple benefits as a result of the Holding Company Reorganization, including a more efficient structure to accommodate growth through acquisitions and opportunities and better management of risks and liabilities.
Each share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Company Common Stock”) and each share of the Company’s Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per shares (“Company Series A Preferred Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization would automatically be converted into an equivalent corresponding share of Rocket Lab Corporation’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Rocket Lab Corporation Common Stock”) or Rocket Lab Corporation’s Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Rocket Lab Corporation Series A Preferred Stock”), respectively, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock being converted.
Accordingly, upon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, the Company’s stockholders immediately prior to the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization would become stockholders of Rocket Lab Corporation. The stockholders of the Company would not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the conversion of their shares of Company Common Stock in the Holding Company Reorganization.
The Holding Company Reorganization would be conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which provides for the formation of a holding company without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporation. The conversion of stock would occur automatically without any action on the part of existing securityholders. Immediately after the Holding Company Reorganization, stock certificates and book-entries that previously represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock would represent the same number of shares of the corresponding shares of Rocket Lab Corporation Common Stock or Rocket Lab Corporation Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable. Following the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, Rocket Lab Corporation Common Stock would continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market on an uninterrupted basis under the symbol “RKLB” with a new CUSIP number. Immediately after consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, Rocket Lab Corporation would have, on a consolidated basis, the same directors, assets, businesses and operations as the Company had immediately prior to the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization. The directors of Rocket Lab Corporation and their committee memberships and titles would be the same as the directors of the Company immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization. The executive officers and officers of Rocket Lab Corporation would be the same as the executive officers and officers, respectively, of the Company immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization, with the same title, duties and responsibilities.
The Company may determine not to implement the Holding Company Reorganization or the completion of the Holding Company Reorganization could be delayed beyond the currently anticipated timeframe, including for factors beyond the control of the Company.

The net proceeds to Host L.P. from the sale of the Series M senior notes, after deducting the underwriting discount, de minimis original issue discount and estimated transaction expenses, are estimated to be approximately $490 million. Host L.P. intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Series M senior notes, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of the outstanding $500 million aggregate principal amount of Host L.P.’s Series E senior notes due 2025 (the “Series E senior notes”).

Under the terms of the Series E senior notes, the redemption price will be (a) 100.000% of the principal amount thereof
plus
(b) accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
The Series E senior notes are being redeemed with the net proceeds from Host L.P.’s issuance of its Series M senior notes, together with cash on hand.
Forward-Looking Statements
In this Current Report on Form 8-K, we make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “expect,” “may,” “intend,” “predict,” “project,” “plan,” “will,” “estimate” and other similar terms and phrases. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. These risks and uncertainties include our ability to apply the proceeds of the Series M senior notes as currently intended and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described in our Annual Report on Form 10–K for the year ended December 31, 2024, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that we will attain these expectations or that any deviations will not be material. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we disclaim any obligations or undertaking to publicly release updates to any forward-looking statement contained in this report to conform the statement to actual results or changes in our expectations.

Geveden, President and Chief Executive Officer, on May 7, 2025 with a target value of $5.5 million. This award is intended to further incentivize long-term shareholder value creation and contains aggressive performance hurdles that must be met to generate payouts under the terms of the award. The PSU component of the award, with a grant date fair value of $2.2 million, will cliff vest on December 31, 2027, subject to the achievement of cumulative revenue (50%) and EBITDA margin expansion (50%) targets for the performance period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027 (the “First Performance Period”). The number of PSUs earned will be based on the level of performance achieved during the First Performance Period with potential payouts ranging from 0% to 150% on each metric. The terms of the PSU award agreement are largely consistent with the Company’s prior PSU award agreements with the exclusion of retirement-related vesting provisions that would otherwise be applicable to Mr. Geveden. The NQPSO component of the award, with a grant date fair value of $3.3 million, will cliff vest on December 31, 2027, subject to the achievement of total shareholder return relative to the S&P Aerospace and Defense Select Index for the performance period May 7, 2025 through December 31, 2027 (the “Second Performance Period”). The number of NQPSOs earned will be based on the level of performance achieved during the Second Performance Period with potential payouts ranging from 0% to 150%. The forms of NQPSO and PSU award agreements are included as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on May 5, 2025 and incorporated herein by reference.

On May 8, 2025, MGM Resorts International, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into an employment agreement with William Hornbuckle, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the “Employment Agreement”), replacing Mr. Hornbuckle’s existing agreement, which was dated as of September 1, 2022 and had a termination date of August 31, 2026, given the importance of ensuring that Mr. Hornbuckle continue to lead the Company for the long term. The Employment Agreement provides for a term until December 31, 2028 with a minimum base salary remaining at $2,000,000 per year.
The Employment Agreement provides for an annual target bonus equal to 250% of Mr. Hornbuckle’s base salary; provided that, any amounts paid in excess of 150% of Mr. Hornbuckle’s target bonus will be paid in fully vested deferred restricted stock units payable in 33% installments over the 3-year period following the grant date (and subject to acceleration in the event Mr. Hornbuckle’s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason) (“DRSUs”).
The Employment Agreement also provides that, subject to the discretion of the Human Capital and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board, Mr. Hornbuckle will be eligible for annual equity grants in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 with an expected value of $10,000,000 each year, consistent with his prior agreement. Annual equity awards are expected to be provided 50% in the form of performance share units and 50% in the form of restricted stock units. The Employment Agreement further provides Mr. Hornbuckle with certain other benefits and perquisites, which are discussed in detail in the Agreement.
The Employment Agreement also provides for a special one-time cash bonus of $8,000,000 (less applicable tax withholdings) (the “Signing Bonus”). The Signing Bonus is subject to Mr. Hornbuckle’s continued employment with the Company through the end of the term. If Mr. Hornbuckle is terminated for cause or voluntarily resigns (other than for good cause) then Mr. Hornbuckle will reimburse the Company a pro-rata amount based on days employed after the effective date of the Employment Agreement compared to days from the effective date through December 31, 2028.
In the event of a termination of Mr. Hornbuckle’s employment as the result of his death or a termination by the Company due to disability, the Company will pay Mr. Hornbuckle one year of salary payable at regular payroll intervals (less any payments received from an employer-paid short term disability policy). In the event of death or disability, Mr. Hornbuckle will not be required to reimburse the Company for a pro-rata portion of the Retention Bonus.
The Employment Agreement further provides that the at the end of the term, the Company will offer Mr. Hornbuckle a new employment agreement as a Special Advisor and member of the Board of the Japan Integrated Resort project for a monthly salary of $25,000 through the opening of the project. The Company also agreed to consider in good faith a success bonus, payable in cash, upon the opening of the Japan Integrated Resort project.
In the event of a termination by the Company for no cause or by Mr. Hornbuckle for good cause prior to the end of the term of the Hornbuckle Employment Agreement or for the 12-month period thereafter, Mr. Hornbuckle will receive (i) one and a half times (A) his annual base salary as in effect on May 8, 2025 and (B) his target bonus, payable in 12 monthly installments and (ii) a lump sum payment equal to the cost of 24 months of COBRA coverage payable in 12 monthly installments. In the event of such termination, Mr. Hornbuckle will not be required to reimburse the Company for a pro-rata portion of the Retention Bonus. Any such severance payments will be subject to applicable taxes and Mr. Hornbuckle’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims.
The Employment Agreement also contains a non-compete covenant generally prohibiting Mr. Hornbuckle from providing services to a competitor or soliciting employees or business contacts for 12 months following his termination of employment or for 12 months following the term of the Employment Agreement. In addition, the Employment Agreement mandates that Mr. Hornbuckle’s confidentiality obligations continue even after his termination of employment.

Agreement.
On May 8, 2025 (the “Closing Date”),
PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “Issuer” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) closed the
previously announced offering (the “Offering”) of $850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s 6.875% Senior
Notes due 2032 (the “Notes”). The Issuer sold the Notes to the initial purchasers in the Offering, which was exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Notes were offered for
resale to purchasers reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities
Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Proceeds from the Offering will be used for the redemption of the Company’s 5.375% senior notes due October 2025 and the remaining
proceeds will be used for the repayment of borrowings under the Company’s secured MSR facilities and other secured indebtedness
and for other general corporate purposes.
The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of May 8, 2025 (the “Indenture”), among the Issuer, the guarantors
party thereto, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. Interest on the Notes accrues beginning on May 8, 2025 at
a rate of 6.875% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November
15, 2025. The Notes mature on May 15, 2032.
The Indenture contains customary terms, events of default and covenants for an issuer of non-investment grade debt securities. These covenants
include limitations on, among other things, incurring additional debt or issuing certain preferred shares, paying dividends on or making
other distributions in respect of capital stock or making other restricted payments, making certain investments, selling or transferring
certain assets, creating liens on certain assets to secure debt, consolidating, merging, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially
all assets, entering into certain transactions with affiliates and designating subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.
Prior to May 15, 2028, the Issuer may, at its option and on any one or more occasions, redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a
make-whole premium.
Prior to May 15, 2028, the Issuer may, at its option and on any one or more occasions, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes with an amount equal to or less than the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 106.875% plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
On or after May 15, 2028, the Issuer may, at its option and on any one or more occasions, redeem some or all of the Notes at the applicable
redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If a “change of control triggering event” (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the holders of the Notes may require the Issuer
to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness
of the Issuer, equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and effectively subordinated
to any future secured indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of the value of collateral securing such indebtedness.
The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Issuer’s
existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries). The guarantees will be senior unsecured
obligations of the guarantors and will rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the guarantors, equally
in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantors and effectively subordinated to any future secured
indebtedness of the guarantors to the extent of the value of collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes and the guarantees will
be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.
The foregoing summaries of the Indenture and
the Notes do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Indenture, a copy of which is filed as
Exhibit 4.1 to this Form 8-K, and such document is incorporated herein by reference.

As
previously disclosed
, on June 16, 2023, Black Hills Corporation, a South Dakota corporation (the “Company”),
entered into an Equity Distribution Sales Agreement (the “Existing Sales Agreement”), by and among (a) the Company,
(b) each of Bank of Montreal, Bank of America, N.A., MUFG Securities EMEA plc, Mizuho Markets Americas LLC, and Royal Bank of Canada
(each a “Forward Purchaser” and together, the “Forward Purchasers”), (c) each of BMO Capital
Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., MUFG Securities Americas Inc., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, and RBC Capital Markets, LLC (each
in its capacity as sales agent and/or principal, an “Agent” and together, the “Agents”), and (d) each
of BMO Capital Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., MUFG Securities Americas Inc., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, and RBC Capital Markets,
LLC (each in its capacity as agent for its affiliated Forward Purchaser (each, a “Forward Seller” and together, the“Forward Sellers”), with respect to the offering and sale from time to time through the Agents of shares of the Company’s
common stock, par value $1.00, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $400,000,000 (the “Shares”), through
an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) utilizing the Company’s shelf Registration
Statement on Form S-3 originally filed on June 16, 2023 (Registration No.

33-272739)
(the “Shelf”).
On May 8, 2025, the Company entered into a
First Amendment to Equity Distribution Sales Agreement (the “First Amendment”), dated May 8, 2025, by and among the
Company, the Forward Purchasers, the Agents and the Forward Sellers (the Existing Sales Agreement as amended by the First Amendment, the“Sales Agreement”). The First Amendment, among other things provides for the continuation of the ATM Program using
the Shelf and resets the size of the ATM Program to an aggregate gross sale price of up to $400,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the
First Amendment aggregate gross sales price limitation supersedes and replaces the aggregate gross sales price limitation provided in
the Existing Sales Agreement. The offering of the Shares will be made pursuant to the Shelf, a base prospectus dated June 16, 2023,
and Prospectus Supplement dated May 8, 2025. Except as modified by the First Amendment, the Sales Agreement and the form of master
forward confirmation included therein remain in full force and effect.
In
the ordinary course of business, certain of the parties to the Sales Agreement or their respective affiliates have provided and may in
the future provide commercial, financial advisory or investment banking services for the Company and its subsidiaries for which they have
received or will receive customary compensation. For example, affiliates of certain of the parties to the Sales Agreement
are lenders
and/or agents under certain of our existing credit facilities. To the extent that we use the net proceeds from the offering to repay amounts
we have borrowed, may borrow or re-borrow in the future under such facilities, those lenders will receive their pro rata portion of the
proceeds from this offering we use to pay any such amounts.
The summary of the First
Amendment in this report does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the First Amendment, which
is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto.
In connection with the
issuance and sale of the Shares, the Company is also filing a legal opinion regarding the validity of the Shares as Exhibit 5.1 for
the purpose of incorporating the opinion into the Registration Statement.

On May 8, 2025, Haemonetics Corporation (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 29, 2025. A copy of the press release is furnished with this report as Exhibit 99.1.
The foregoing information, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
Item 2.05  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
In May 2025, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new market and regional alignment initiative and delegated authority to the Company’s management to determine the details of the specific actions that will comprise the initiative. This new strategic initiative is designed to improve operational performance and reduce costs by directing the Company’s resources toward the markets and geographies that offer the greatest growth and portfolio advancement opportunities. We expect to incur aggregate restructuring and restructuring-related charges of approximately $20 million associated with this initiative, approximately half of which we expect will consist of severance and other employee costs and the remainder of which will consist of other exit costs, primarily related to third party arrangements. These charges, substantially all of which will result in cash outlays, will be incurred as the specific actions required to execute on the initiative are identified and approved and are expected to continue through the end of fiscal 2027. We expect savings from this initiative of approximately $30 million on an annualized basis once the initiative is completed.
The amounts and timing of estimated costs and savings are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements about the market and regional alignment initiative. These statements are based on our current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which we can give no firm assurance. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made. As it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of our actual future financial condition or results.
These forward-looking statements, like any forward-looking statements, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Factors that may influence or contribute to the inaccuracy of the forward-looking statements or cause actual results to differ materially from expected or desired results may include, without limitation, whether the Company will be able to implement the market and regional alignment initiative as planned, whether the expected amount of the costs associated with the market and regional alignment initiative will exceed the Company’s forecasts, and whether the Company will be able to realize the full amount of estimated savings from the market and regional alignment initiative. Investors should consult the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including the Company’s reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K) for information about additional risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

On May 8, 2025, Diodes Incorporated (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing its first quarter ended March 31, 2025 financial results. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
In the press release, the Company utilizes financial measures and terms not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) in order to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing the Company’s operating results in a manner that enables investors to more thoroughly evaluate its current performance as compared to past performance. The Company also believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors with a more informed baseline for modeling the Company’s future financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for the same purpose. The Company believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses in analyzing results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results and may differ from similar measures used by other companies. See Exhibit 99.1 for a description and reconciliation with GAAP of the non-GAAP measures used.
The information furnished in this Item 2.02, including the exhibit incorporated by reference, will not be treated as “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. This information will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or into another filing under the Exchange Act, unless that filing expressly refers to specific information in this Report.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 also provides an update on the Company’s business outlook, that is intended to be within the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) as comprising forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act.
The information furnished in this Item 7.01, including the exhibit incorporated by reference, will not be treated as “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. This information will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act, or into another filing under the Exchange Act, unless that filing expressly refers to specific information in this Report.

(d)    On May 2, 2025, the Board of Directors expanded the size of the Board to nine members and appointed Andy L. Nemeth as a Class III director to fill the vacancy created thereby. Mr. Nemeth’s appointment is the result of a process conducted by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of the Board to recruit a successor to Thomas J. Hansen whose term will expire at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in October 2025 (the “Annual Meeting”). Having reached the Company’s mandatory retirement age for directors, Mr. Hansen is not eligible for re-election and will retire as of the Annual Meeting at which time the number of directors on the Board shall revert to eight. In order to facilitate a smooth orientation and transition, Mr. Nemeth has been appointed for an initial term to expire at the Annual Meeting in connection with which it is the intention of the Board to propose that the shareholders elect Mr. Nemeth (in addition to the remaining Class III directors) for a three-year term to expire at the annual shareholders meeting in October 2028. The Board currently anticipates that Mr. Nemeth will serve on the Board’s Audit Committee.
Mr. Nemeth, age 56, is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Patrick Industries, Inc., a NASDAQ listed manufacturer of component products and materials for the recreational vehicle, marine, manufactured housing, and industrial markets. He has been the Chairman of the Board of Patrick since May 2024 and Chief Executive Officer since January 2020. Prior to that time, Mr. Nemeth was the President of Patrick from January 2016 to July 2021, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer from May 2004 to December 2015, and Secretary-Treasurer from 2002 to 2015. He was also the Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer from 2003 to 2004.
In connection with his appointment, there are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Nemeth and any other person regarding his appointment nor are there any related person transactions involving the Company and Mr. Nemeth. As a director, Mr. Nemeth will receive such annual compensation as is payable to all other directors and as most recently set forth in the Company’s Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting that occurred on October 24, 2024 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 6, 2024."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Overview
This press release and the accompanying schedules include non-generally accepted accounting principle (non-GAAP) financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and total Available Cash before Reserves. In this press release, we also present total Segment Margin as if it were a non-GAAP measure. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because such measures may include or exclude other specified items. The accompanying schedules provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance or (ii) as being singularly important in any particular context; they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information. Our Available Cash before Reserves, Adjusted EBITDA and total Segment Margin measures are just three of the relevant data points considered from time to time.
When evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions (including making discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of directors and management team have access to a wide range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational information; various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance; liquidity and similar measures; income; cash flow expectations for us; and certain information regarding some of our peers.  Additionally, our board of directors and management team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time to time.  We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external user.
Available Cash before Reserves
Purposes, Uses and Definition
Available Cash before Reserves, often referred to by others as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:
(1)
the financial performance of our assets;
(2)
our operating performance;
(3)
the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;
(4)
the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and
(5)
our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our preferred and common units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.
We define Available Cash before Reserves (“Available Cash before Reserves”) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for certain items, the most significant of which in the relevant reporting periods have been the sum of maintenance capital utilized, interest expense, net, cash tax expense and cash distributions paid to our Class A Convertible Preferred unitholders.
Disclosure Format Relating to Maintenance Capital
We use a modified format relating to maintenance capital requirements because our maintenance capital expenditures vary materially in nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount from time to time.  We believe that, without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the context of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our modified disclosure format provides those users with information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available Cash before Reserves). Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period.
Maintenance Capital Requirements
Maintenance Capital Expenditures
Maintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances.
Prior to 2014, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures were (a) related to our pipeline assets and similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those historical expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had very little (if any) discretion as to whether or when we incurred them. We had to incur them in order to continue to operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices. If we had not made those expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines, which would not have been economically feasible.
An example of a non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or economically in the absence of such replacement.
Beginning with 2014, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time will be (a) related to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels, trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c) potentially material in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those expenditures will be discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we incur them.  We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner. If we chose not to make those expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically, although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses, including maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses.
In summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are experiencing changes in the nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was required historically. Management’s increasing ability to determine if and when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures. We believe it would be inappropriate to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe are similar in nature in this context to certain other discretionary expenditures, such as growth capital expenditures, distributions/dividends and equity buybacks. Unfortunately, not all maintenance capital expenditures are clearly discretionary or non-discretionary in nature. Therefore, we developed a measure, maintenance capital utilized, that we believe is more useful in the determination of Available Cash before Reserves.
Maintenance Capital Utilized
We believe our maintenance capital utilized measure is the most useful quarterly maintenance capital requirements measure to use to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure. We define our maintenance capital utilized measure as that portion of the amount of previously incurred maintenance capital expenditures that we utilize during the relevant quarter, which would be equal to the sum of the maintenance capital expenditures we have incurred for each project/component in prior quarters allocated ratably over the useful lives of those projects/components.
Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period. Because we did not use our maintenance capital utilized measure before 2014, our maintenance capital utilized calculations will reflect the utilization of solely those maintenance capital expenditures incurred since December 31, 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA
Purposes, Uses and Definition
Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:
(1)
the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structures or historical cost basis;
(2)
our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing and capital structure;
(3)
the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;
(4)
the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and
(5)
our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our preferred and common units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.
We define Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as Net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (including impairment, write-offs, accretion and similar items) after eliminating other non-cash revenues, expenses, gains, losses and charges (including any loss on asset dispositions), plus or minus certain other select items that we view as not indicative of our core operating results (collectively, “Select Items”).  Although we do not necessarily consider all of our Select Items to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, we believe that an understanding of these Select Items is important to the evaluation of our core operating results. The most significant Select Items in the relevant reporting periods are set forth in this press release.

At the 2025 annual meeting of the stockholders of Axcelis Technologies, Inc.
(the “Company”) held on May 7, 2025 (the “Annual Meeting”), the Company’s stockholders approved an
amendment to the Company’s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Amended Equity Plan”) to increase the number of shares of
common stock reserved under the plan for future issuance by 3,000,000 shares. The Company’s Board of Directors and the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors previously approved the Amended Equity Plan, subject to such stockholder approval. The Amended Equity Plan provides
for the grant of equity awards to employees (including the executive officers) and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries, and
all directors of the Company. Prior grants under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan to our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer, and
other named executive officers have been disclosed in the Company’s definitive proxy statement for the Annual Meeting filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2025 (the “Proxy Statement”). Awards that may be granted in the future
under the Amended Equity Plan to our executive officers are not determinable because grants are subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
A summary of the material terms of the Amended Equity Plan is set forth in the Proxy Statement and a copy of the full text of the plan is filed

BKV,0001628280-25-023819,2025-05-08,"1.01, 9.01","Item 1.01. Entry into A Material Definitive Agreement
On May 8, 2025 (the “Execution Date”), BKV dCarbon Ventures, LLC (“dCarbon Ventures”), a wholly owned subsidiary of BKV Corporation (“BKV” or the “Company”), together with C Squared Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Investor” and, together with dCarbon Ventures, the “JV Members”) and, for the limited purposes specified therein, BKV, entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement of BKV dCarbon Project, LLC (the “BKV-CIP JV Agreement”) forming BKV dCarbon Project, LLC (the “BKV-CIP JV” or “JV”) for the purpose of developing carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (“CCUS”) projects. On the Execution Date and contemporaneously with their entry into the BKV-CIP JV Agreement, the JV Members entered into ancillary agreements including, but not limited to, a master services agreement between BKV and the JV (the “Master Services Agreement”), each of which are further described below.
Joint Venture Agreement
Capital Contributions and Capital Commitment
.  Pursuant to the BKV-CIP JV Agreement, (i) dCarbon Ventures will contribute certain CCUS projects, related assets and/or cash, in exchange for Class A Units (the “Class A Units”) representing no less than a 51% interest in the BKV-CIP JV and (ii) subject to the Condition Precedent to Funding (as described below), Investor will contribute up to $500 million in cash to the BKV-CIP JV over the course of five years (the “Investor Commitment”) as and when capital is called pursuant to the terms of the BKV-CIP JV Agreement in exchange for Class B Units (the “Class B Units”) representing no more than a 49% interest in the JV. The Investor Commitment may be increased to $1 billion upon the mutual written agreement of the JV Members. As of the Execution Date, dCarbon Ventures has contributed to the BKV-CIP JV its ownership of its Barnett Zero and Eagle Ford CCUS projects. Subject to the limitations contained in the BKV-CIP JV Agreement, the JV will be funded in cash (i) initially by Investor until Investor has contributed cash equal to 49% of the total value contributed by the JV Members to the JV, (ii) next 50% by dCarbon Ventures and 50% by Investor until specified minimum return targets are achieved by Investor and (iii) thereafter, 51% by dCarbon Ventures and 49% by Investor. The Investor may from time to time present additional CCUS projects to the JV. If dCarbon Ventures and the Investor mutually agree such additional CCUS projects will be contributed to the JV.
Distributions
.  Other than quarterly tax distributions and distributions in respect of a deemed liquidation event (as defined in the BKV-CIP JV Agreement), distributions will be made in accordance with a waterfall until specified minimum return targets are achieved by Investor.
Exclusivity
.  BKV has agreed that it and its affiliates will develop CCUS projects exclusively through the BKV-CIP JV except that any CCUS projects that are rejected by Investor for development by the BKV-CIP JV may be developed solely through dCarbon Ventures outside of the JV. This exclusivity commitment will terminate if Investor rejects 40% or more of the qualified CCUS projects presented to the JV in any sequential 15-month period from the Execution Date.
Governance
:  The BKV-CIP JV is governed by a board of managers (the “BKV-CIP Board”) consisting of five members, three of whom are designated by dCarbon Ventures and two of whom are designated by Investor. Most operational decisions and activities of the BKV-CIP JV are reserved for approval by a majority of the members of the BKV-CIP Board, but Investor has customary minority investor rights, including veto rights with respect to, among other things, the amount and timing of distributions to the JV Members, the JV’s annual budget, any sale or IPO of the JV, any change in senior management of the JV, and other significant and related party transactions of the JV.
Environmental Attributes
:  The JV will monetize all environmental attributes, including pursuant to a first right of BKV or its affiliates to purchase such environmental attributes at fair market value.
Investor Equity Swap Option
.  Following the third anniversary of the Execution Date, Investor may elect to exchange its Class B Units for a 49% common equity interest in dCarbon Ventures, subject to adjustment to the extent that dCarbon Ventures owns assets in excess of its interests in the JV (the “Equity Swap Option”). In the event that Investor exercises the Equity Swap Option, BKV and the JV Members would enter into definitive agreements providing that (x) BKV would pursue its CCUS business exclusively through dCarbon Ventures, (y) dCarbon Ventures would be governed by board of managers comprised in the same manner as the BKV-CIP Board, and (z) Investor would be entitled to certain customary registration rights and minority investor rights, including preemptive rights and veto rights.
Transfer Restrictions; Right of First Offer; Co-Sale Right
.  Each JV Member is subject to restrictions on its ability to transfer its units in the BKV-CIP JV other than to affiliates. In addition, except with respect to specified exceptions, each JV Member has a right of first offer to purchase the other Member’s units in connection with any proposed transfer. Investor has a co-sale right in connection with a proposed transfer of Class A Units by dCarbon Ventures.
Investor Drag Right
.  Subject to the right of first offer, unless Investor receives cash distributions that meet its minimum return targets by the fifth anniversary of the Execution Date, Investor will have the right to initiate a sale of the BKV-CIP JV, which would be conducted in a manner that maximizes the value of the JV.
Investor Redemption Right
.  Upon delivery of written notice to BKV during the 30-day period immediately before the second anniversary of the Execution Date, Investor has a one-time right to sell its Class B Units to the Company for cash in an amount equal to 1.65x all capital contributed to the JV by Investor as of such date, less prior distributions made to Investor. BKV would own 100% of the JV equity interests and related cash flow if this right is exercised.
Minimum Asset Coverage Ratio.
The BKV-CIP JV is required to maintain an asset coverage ratio of at least 2.0:1.0. If the JV falls below
such threshold, Investor may require dCarbon Ventures to provide collateral sufficient to correct the deficiency, which obligation is guaranteed by the Company.
Additional Agreements
45Q Letter Agreement
.  On the Execution Date, BKV entered into the 45Q Letter Agreement with Investor, dCarbon Ventures and the JV, which prohibits dCarbon Ventures from requiring capital contributions from Investor until after June 1, 2025 (the “Condition Precedent to Funding”) and provides the Members with a right to terminate the BKV-CIP JV Agreement and all related agreements and unwind the JV and related contributions if, prior to June 1, 2025, there occurs (i) a material change in legislation that negatively and materially impacts the availability of Section 45Q tax credits, or (ii) a submission to the United States Committee on the Budget of the United States House or Representatives or the United States Senate by any other committee that would, if enacted or adopted, be reasonably likely to negatively and materially impact the availability of Section 45Q tax credits.
Master Services Agreement
.  On the Execution Date, BKV entered into the Master Services Agreement with the BKV-CIP JV pursuant to which BKV and dCarbon Ventures agreed to provide certain administrative, technical, operational and other services as required by the JV in consideration for an annual fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses.

ANIP,0001104659-25-045937,2025-05-08,8.01,"Item 8.01             Other Events
On April 10, 2025, ANI Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (“ANI” or the “Company”) filed a definitive proxy statement (the “Annual Meeting Proxy Statement”)
for the solicitation of proxies in connection with the 2025 annual meeting of shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) to consider
and vote on, among other proposals, the approval of the Company’s Amended and Restated 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (“Proposal
5”).
The
Company has determined to supplement and clarify information provided in Proposal 5 of the Annual Meeting Proxy Statement as set forth
below (the “Proxy Supplement”). The
first table located under the sub-heading “Purpose of Share Reserve Increase”has been updated to
include non-shareholder approved inducement grants
as
of the record date
.
There is no change to the location, the record
date, or any of the other proposals to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders who have previously submitted their proxies or
otherwise voted and who do not want to change their vote need not take any action.
AMENDMENT AND SUPPLEMENT TO THE 2025 ANNUAL
PROXY STATEMENT
The following disclosures in this Current Report
on Form 8-K supplement, and should be read in conjunction with, the disclosures contained in the Company’s definitive proxy statement
(the “Annual Proxy Statement”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 10, 2025,
which in turn should be read in its entirety. To the extent the information set forth herein differs from or updates information contained
in the Annual Proxy Statement, the information set forth herein shall supersede or supplement the information in the Annual Proxy Statement.
All other information in the Annual Proxy Statement remains unchanged.
As provided in the Annual Proxy Statement, the
Company is seeking stockholder approval of, among other things, the approval of the Company’s Amended and Restated 2022 Stock Incentive
Plan (“Proposal 5”). The purpose of the supplemental disclosure is to clarify in Proposal 5 that the first table located under
the sub-heading “Purpose of Share Reserve Increase” includes non-shareholder approved inducement grants.
Terms used herein, unless otherwise defined,
have the meanings set forth in the Annual Proxy Statement.
Purpose of Share Reserve Increase
In 2024, the Stock Plan was amended and restated
to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the Stock Plan. As of March 24, 2025, a total of 1,177,800
shares of our common stock remained available for future grants under the Stock Plan. We believe that the current share reserve amount
is insufficient to meet our future needs with respect to attracting, motivating and retaining key executives and employees in a competitive
market for talent. We consider the Stock Plan to be a vital element of our employee compensation program and believe that the continued
ability to grant stock awards at competitive levels is in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders. In recent years, our
compensation structure and strategy has included issuance of grants and share usage to align with market standards.
The table below shows the stock awards that were
outstanding under the shareholder-approved Stock Plan and non-shareholder-approved inducement grants as of March 24, 2025. As of
March 24, 2025, the closing sale price of a share of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market was $65.98.

Retirements of Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
On May 5, 2025, Jean Bua informed the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company of her intention to step down as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective May 31, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), as she transitions toward retirement. The Company has entered into a transition agreement (the “Bua Transition Agreement”) with Ms. Bua, pursuant to which Ms. Bua will continue as an employee of the Company in the capacity of Senior Advisor through June 30, 2026, subject to her earlier termination or resignation (the “Bua Separation Date”). She will continue to receive her existing base compensation and benefits through the Bua Separation Date.  In addition, Ms. Bua will remain eligible to receive her annual incentive bonus for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, but will not be entitled to receive an annual incentive bonus for any other year.  Through the Bua Separation Date, Ms. Bua will also be eligible to vest, in accordance with their terms, in any outstanding awards under the Company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2019 Plan”) of (i) time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), subject to her continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting dates, and (ii) performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”), subject to achievement of the applicable performance goals over the relevant performance periods, if and as certified by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”), and subject to her continued service with the Company through the dates on which the Compensation Committee certifies achievement of the performance goals.  In the event that, prior to the Bua Separation Date, Ms. Bua’s employment is terminated without Cause (as defined in the 2019 Plan) following a Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Plan), Ms. Bua will be entitled to (i) continued payment of base salary through June 30, 2026, less applicable withholdings and deductions, and (ii) continued eligibility for vesting of PSUs through June 30, 2026 (and payment thereunder to the extent the Compensation Committee certifies performance achievement on or before such date).  After the Bua Separation Date, it is expected that Ms. Bua will remain a non-employee advisor to the Company with the same duties and responsibilities as set forth in the Bua Transition Agreement and will not receive further compensation other than continued vesting of her RSUs in accordance with their terms. Such non-employee advisory period will end when all her outstanding RSUs are fully vested.  In the event that there is a Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Plan) while Ms. Bua is serving as an employee or non-employee advisor of the Company, all of her unvested RSUs, to the extent not otherwise accelerated under the terms of the 2019 Plan, will automatically vest in full simultaneously with such Change in Control.  Ms. Bua’s Amended and Restated Severance Agreement was terminated upon entering into the Bua Transition Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Bua Transition Agreement contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of such document, a copy of
which will be filed as exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.
Also on May 5, 2025, Michael Szabados informed the Board of his intention to step down as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective as of the Effective Date, as he transitions toward retirement. The Company has entered into a transition agreement (the “Szabados Transition Agreement”) with Mr. Szabados, pursuant to which Mr. Szabados will continue as a full-time employee of the Company in the capacity of Senior Advisor through June 30, 2026, subject to his earlier termination or resignation (the “Szabados Employment Separation Date”). He will continue to receive his existing base compensation and benefits through the Szabados Employment Separation Date.  In addition, Mr. Szabados will remain eligible to receive his annual incentive bonus for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, but will not be entitled to receive an annual incentive bonus for any other year.  Through the Szabados Employment Separation Date and as long as he continues to serve on the Board, Mr. Szabados will have the same duties and responsibilities as forth in the Szabados Transition Agreement and Mr. Szabados will also be eligible to vest, in accordance with their terms, in any outstanding awards under the 2019 Plan of time-based RSUs, subject to his continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting dates.  Through the Szabados Employment Separation Date (but not during any periods thereafter including any service on the Board), Mr. Szabados will also be eligible to vest, in accordance with their terms, in any outstanding awards under the 2019 Plan of PSUs, subject to achievement of the applicable performance goals over the relevant performance periods, if and as certified by the Compensation Committee, and subject to his continued employment with the Company through the dates on which the Compensation Committee certifies achievement of the performance goals. In the event that prior to the Szabados Employment Separation Date, Mr. Szabados’ employment is terminated without Cause (as defined in the 2019 Plan) following a Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Plan), Mr. Szabados will be entitled to (i) continued payment of base salary through June 30, 2026, less applicable withholdings and deductions, and (ii) continued eligibility for vesting of PSUs through June 30, 2026 (and payment thereunder to the extent the Compensation Committee certifies performance achievement on or before such date). In the event that there is a Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Plan) while Mr. Szabados is serving as an employee, advisor or member of the Board of Directors of the Company, all of his unvested RSUs, to the extent not otherwise accelerated under the terms of the 2019 Plan, will vest in full simultaneously with such Change in Control.   Mr. Szabados’ Amended and Restated Severance Agreement was terminated upon entering into the Szabados Transition Agreement.
Following the Effective Date, Mr. Szabados will continue to serve as a Class III member and Vice Chairman of the Board. However, Mr. Szabados will not be eligible to receive compensation under the Company’s non-employee director compensation policy until after the conclusion of his full-time employment as a Senior Advisor with the Company and will not receive equity awards under the non-employee director compensation policy until all RSUs granted prior to the Szabados Employment Separation Date have fully vested.
The foregoing description of the Szabados Transition Agreement contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of such document, a copy of which will be filed as exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.
NetScout’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Board as a whole thank Ms. Bua and Mr. Szabados for their long service and dedication to NetScout and its stockholders.

In such event, such executive officer will receive 12 months of his then-
current salary, and if such termination occurs after a change of control, such executive officer will also receive a prorated amount of his annual incentive bonus target, based on the months elapsed in such year that in any event will not be less than 50% of his annual incentive bonus target, and accelerated vesting of any outstanding unvested equity awards under the 2019 Plan, or any successors thereto, that would have vested or become exercisable within one year of such termination.

Other Events.
Liquidia Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), is voluntarily filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to correct certain accounting errors that were determined not to be material to any of its previously issued consolidated financial statements.​Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements​During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company identified immaterial accounting errors in its accounting treatment of the fourth and fifth amendments to the revenue interest financing agreement with HealthCare Royalty Partners IV, L.P. (“HCR”) dated January 9, 2023 (the “HCR Agreement”). While the Company initially concluded that the amendments constituted extinguishments under ASC 470
Debt
, the Company has reevaluated the accounting treatment, revised its conclusions and determined the amendments to be modifications.  As a result of the revision, the loss or gain on extinguishment has been eliminated and an adjustment to interest expense resulting from the modifications has been recorded, with corresponding adjustments to the long-term debt and accumulated deficit accounts. The identified accounting errors impacted the Company’s previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 Form 10-K”) and interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 (the “Q1 2024 Form 10-Q”), as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024 (the “Q2 2024 Form 10-Q”), and as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 (the “Q3 2024 Form 10-Q”). The Company has evaluated these accounting errors and their effect on prior periods under the guidance of Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, “Materiality,” codified in ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. Based on its assessment, the Company determined that the accounting errors were not material to any previously issued consolidated financial statements. However, the Company is voluntarily revising its previously issued consolidated financial statements and related notes included in its 2024 Form 10-K to correct for the immaterial accounting errors.
Revisions to Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of the 2024 Form 10-K are filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and are incorporated by reference into this Item 8.01. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has revised its audit report, which is filed as part of Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference into this Item 8.01. PwC’s currently dated consent is filed as Exhibit 23.1 hereto and incorporated by reference into this Item 8.01.
Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K does not reflect events occurring subsequent to the filing of the 2024 Form 10-K, does not modify or update the disclosures other than as required to reflect the revisions to correct the immaterial accounting errors as described above, and is not an amendment to, or restatement of, the 2024 Form 10-K. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K should be read together with the 2024 Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC.
Impact on the Company’s Internal Control over Financial Reporting​The Company has also evaluated the impact of the accounting errors on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is still effective. Accordingly, the Company has also determined that no changes are necessary to management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting included in Part II, Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures” of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part I, Item 4. “Controls and Procedures” in each of the Q1 2024 Form 10-Q, Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and Q3 2024 Form 10-Q, respectively.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations​Based on the Company’s assessment that the accounting errors were not material to any previously issued consolidated financial statements, the Company has determined that no changes are necessary to Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2024 Form 10-K and Part 1, Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in each of the Q1 2024 Form 10-Q, Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and Q3 2024 Form 10-Q, respectively.
Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements​This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K may be forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipates,” “believes,” contemplates,” “continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “should,” “targets,” “will,” “would” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: clinical trials, clinical studies and other clinical work (including the funding therefor, anticipated patient enrollment, safety data, study data, trial outcomes, timing or associated costs), regulatory applications and related submission contents and timelines, including the potential for final FDA approval of the NDA for YUTREPIA, which may occur after the expiration of the exclusivity period of TYVASO DPI, if at all, the timelines or outcomes related to patent litigation with United Therapeutics in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, litigation with United Therapeutics that was filed in the Superior Court for Durham County, North Carolina, patent litigation filed against United Therapeutics in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, or any future litigation with United Therapeutics or any other third-party, including any rehearings or appeals with respect to any litigation with United Therapeutics, the issuance of patents by the USPTO and our ability to execute on our strategic or financial initiatives, the potential for additional funding under the HCR Agreement, our anticipated use of net proceeds funded under the HCR Agreement, our estimates regarding future expenses, capital requirements and needs for additional financing, and potential revenue and profitability of YUTREPIA, if approved.
You should refer to the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC for a discussion of important factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K are only predictions, and we may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations included in our forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should therefore not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K.​Item 9.01

On May 8, 2025, the Partnership issued a press release (the “Press Release”) describing its Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Financial Results.  A copy of the Press Release has been furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.
Within the Press Release, we reference net income before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Additionally, we discuss EBITDA excluding the unrealized net gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for derivative instruments and certain other items (“Adjusted EBITDA”).  Our calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented in the Press Release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.
We provide these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they provide the investment community with supplemental measures of operating performance.  In addition, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and industry analysts to evaluate our operating results.
We also reference gross margins, computed as revenues less cost of products sold as those amounts are reported on the consolidated financial statements.  Since cost of products sold does not include depreciation and amortization expense, the gross margin we reference is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Given the nature of our business, the level of profitability in the retail propane, fuel oil, and natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost.  Therefore, we discuss gross margins in order to provide investors and industry analysts with useful information to facilitate their understanding of the impact of the commodity prices on profitability.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 8, 2025, the Company posted an investor presentation to its website at https://investors.sproutsocial.com (the“Investor Presentation”). A copy of the Investor Presentation is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The Company expects to use the Investor Presentation, in whole or in part, and possibly with modifications, in connection with presentations to investors, analysts and others.
The information contained in the Investor Presentation is summary information that is intended to be considered in the context of the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and other public announcements that the Company may make, by press release or otherwise, from time to time. The Investor Presentation speaks only as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise the information contained in the Investor Presentation, although it may do so from time to time. Any such updating may be made through the filing of other reports or documents with the SEC, through press releases or through other public disclosure. In addition, the exhibit furnished herewith contains statements intended as “forward-looking statements” that are subject to the cautionary statements about forward-looking statements set forth in such exhibit. By furnishing the information contained in the Investor Presentation, the Company makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in the Investor Presentation that is required to be disclosed solely by reason of Regulation FD.
This Current Report on Form 8-K and its contents (including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2) are furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the“Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the“Securities Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are based on management’s current opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results. These forward-looking statements are only predictions, not historical fact, and involve certain risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions. Actual results, levels of activity, performance, achievements and events could differ materially from those stated, anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements. While the Company believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results. There are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made herein including the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on February 25, 2025, as supplemented by the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 to be filed with the SEC, as well as other factors described from time to time in the Company's other filings with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. If it does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that the Company will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 8, 2025, Ivanhoe Electric Inc.’s
(the “Company”) publicly listed and 62.5% owned subsidiary, Cordoba Minerals Corp. (“Cordoba”), and Cordoba Minerals
Holdings Ltd., an indirect subsidiary of Cordoba (“Cordoba Barbados”, and together with Cordoba, the “Cordoba Parties”),
made an offer to JCHX Mining Management Co., Ltd. (“JCHX”), Veritas Resources AG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JCHX (“Buyer”),
Naipu Mining Machinery, (“Naipu”), PIA Global Limited, and Hong Kong Zhongan Industry Development Co., Limited (collectively,
the “JCHX Parties”), which those parties accepted (together, the “Agreement”) for the Cordoba Parties to sell
to the JCHX Parties certain assets indirectly constituting the Cordoba Parties’ remaining 50% interest in the Alacrán copper-gold-silver
deposit located in the municipality of Puerto Libertador, Department of Córdoba, Colombia (the “Alacran Copper Project”),
related exploration properties, and certain intercompany receivables, for consideration of up to $128 million, consisting of:·$88 million in cash on closing (the “Closing Payment”);·$12 million in a deferred payment, to be paid within fifteen business days after the earlier of the commencement
of commercial production as defined in the Agreement, or the third anniversary of the closing date; and·a contingent payment if the average daily London Metal Exchange spot copper price during the first twelve
months of commercial production is greater than $12,000 per tonne, consisting of $8 million if the price is between $12,000 and $13,000
per tonne, and $28 million if the price is over $13,000 per tonne.
The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to achieve commercial production within 36 months after the closing date. Cordoba shall use commercially reasonable efforts to distribute
to its shareholders the net proceeds from the Closing Payment after satisfying all liabilities and obligations, such that $5 million will
remain in Cordoba, subject to any required approvals, within six months following the closing date.
JCHX acquired its first 50% of the Alacran Copper
Project in May 2023.
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Buyer shall provide
funding to the Alacran Copper Project in accordance with the budget previously approved by the Cordoba board of directors from the date
of the Agreement until close of the sale or the earlier of (i) termination of the Agreement or (ii) September 30, 2025.
The agreement also calls for certain corporate restructuring steps prior to close intended to facilitate the transfer of ownership of
the Alacran Copper Project and conveyance of certain accounts receivables of Cordoba Barbados.
On the date of the Agreement, the parties entered
into an amendment to that certain framework agreement among Cordoba, Minerales Cordoba S.A.S., Exploradora Córdoba S.A.S., CMH
Colombia S.A.S., JCHX and Intera Mining Investment Limited dated December 8, 2022, as assigned from Intera Mining Investment Limited
to Iniview Mining Investment Limited pursuant to a deed of assignment and adherence dated May 4, 2023.
The closing of the sale is subject to the Environmental
Impact Assessment for the Alacran Copper Project being approved by the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (the environmental
regulator in Colombia), as well as customary conditions, including, without limitation, the entering into of certain ancillary agreements,
conditional approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”), Cordoba shareholder approval by 2/3rds of those shareholders that
vote at a special meeting of shareholders, submission of a simple notice proceeding of transactions contemplated by the Agreement with
the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce, Colombia (“SIC”) in accordance with the applicable laws of Columbia and either
an acknowledgment of receipt of simple notice proceeding of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement shall have been issued by the
SIC without objection or ten business days have elapsed since the notice was delivered to the SIC and no formal response has been received
from the SIC in such time, approval of or filing with the National Development and Reform Commission of the People’s Republic of
China (“PRC”) and Ministry of Commerce of the PRC, and registration with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
Customary provisions related to non-solicitation,
non-competition, confidentiality, representations, warranties and covenants, as well as termination, dispute resolution and indemnification
are detailed in the Agreement. Either the Cordoba Parties or the JCHX Parties may terminate the Agreement if the closing has not occurred
by December 31, 2025.

Forward-Looking Statements
The Company cautions you that statements included
in this Current Report on Form 8-K that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainty, including statements regarding the proposed
sale of the Alacran Copper Project along with the related covenants, closing conditions and the other matters contemplated by the Agreement.
In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “could,”“should,” “would,” “achieve,” “budget,” “scheduled,” “forecasts,”“expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,”“potential” or “continue,” the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking
statements may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth strategies and anticipated trends in our
industry. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date on which they are made. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions concerning future events that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual future events or results may differ
materially from these statements. We believe that the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed
or implied by forward-looking statements include the following: we and JCHX may not successfully obtain all necessary regulatory and third
party approvals and satisfy other applicable conditions to the transactions contemplated herein; the transaction may not close on the
timeline anticipated, or at all; we and Cordoba may not receive all of the payments called for by the Agreement; and such payments may
not be applied in the manner currently anticipated; our mineral projects are all at the exploration stage with no certainty of advancing
to further stages of development; we have no mineral reserves, other than at the Alacran project; we have a limited operating history
on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects; we depend on our material projects for our future operations; our mineral
resource calculations at the Santa Cruz Project are only estimates; actual capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns
may differ significantly from those we have anticipated; the title to some of the mineral properties may be uncertain or defective; our
business is subject to changes in the prices of copper, gold, silver, nickel, cobalt, vanadium and platinum group metals; we have claims
and legal proceedings against one of our subsidiaries; our business is subject to significant risk and hazards associated with exploration
activities, mine development, construction and future mining operations; we may fail to identify attractive acquisition candidates or
joint ventures with strategic partners or be unable to successfully integrate acquired mineral properties or successfully manage joint
ventures; our success is dependent in part on our joint venture partners and their compliance with our agreements with them; our business
is extensively regulated by the United States and foreign governments as well as local governments; the requirements that we obtain, maintain
and renew environmental, construction and mining permits are often a costly and time-consuming process; our non-U.S. operations are subject
to additional political, economic and other uncertainties not generally associated with domestic operations; and our operations may be
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including impacts to the availability of our workforce, government orders that may require temporary
suspension of operations, and the global economy. You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the additional risks described
in our annual report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC, which are available on EDGAR at www.sec.gov. We also
operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing industry. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management
to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. We disclaim
any obligation to update such forward-looking statements, except as required by law."

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 2, 2025, Krispy Kreme, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an incremental assumption agreement and amendment (the “First Amendment”), by and among the Company, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc., as borrower (the “Parent Borrower”), the other loan parties party thereto, with the lenders party thereto and BNP Paribas (“BNP”), as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”).
On May 7, 2025, the Company entered into another incremental assumption agreement and amendment (the “Second Amendment” and, together with the First Amendment, collectively, the “Amendments” and each, an “Amendment”), by and among the Company, the Parent Borrower, the other loan parties party thereto, with the lender party thereto and the Administrative Agent.
Each Amendment amends the Parent Borrower’s existing credit agreement, dated as of March 23, 2023 (as amended and as otherwise modified and in effect immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Amendments, the “Existing Credit Agreement”; the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended by the Amendments, the “Amended Credit Agreement”), by and among the Company, the Parent Borrower, the lenders, and other parties party thereto from time to time, the Administrative Agent and BNP, as collateral agent.
The First Amendment, among other things, (a) established incremental term loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $110,000,000 and (b) imposed certain restrictions on the ability to make Restricted Payments (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), including payments of dividends, if the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) exceeds 3.00:1.00. The Total Net Leverage Ratio was 3.94 to 1.00 as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
The Second Amendment established incremental term loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $15,000,000.
The Parent Borrower borrowed $125,000,000 under the Amendments following their respective execution and delivery. The incremental borrowings made pursuant to each Amendment (i) were used to pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such Amendment and (ii) will be used for general corporate purposes of the Parent Borrower and its subsidiaries (including to finance working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other investments) and for any other purpose not prohibited under the related loan documents.
Except as described in the following sentence, the additional commitments established pursuant to each Amendment and the loans made pursuant thereto have identical terms as those set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement applicable to the existing commitments and loans thereunder (including with respect to interest rates (including the Applicable Rate), maturity date, mandatory prepayments and voluntary prepayments). The incremental term loans made pursuant to each Amendment will amortize in an amount necessary to achieve fungibility with the existing outstanding term loans.
The foregoing description of the First Amendment, the Second Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement is a general description only, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, which are filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Certain of the lenders and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory, investment banking, commercial banking and general financing and treasury services for the Company and/or its subsidiaries, including as an underwriter for one or more public offerings of the Company’s securities, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.

Regulation FD Disclosure.
Cleansing Material
On April 15, 2025, Wolfspeed, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a confidentiality agreement (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) with a certain holder (the “Holder”) that is a member of an ad hoc group of holders of the Company’s 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). The Confidentiality Agreement facilitated the Company’s ability to engage in discussions with the Holder regarding one or more potential transactions involving the 2026 Notes (a “Potential Transaction”). The Potential Transaction was deemed not actionable and the Company decided to no longer pursue the Potential Transaction.
Pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company agreed to publicly disclose certain confidential information previously disclosed to the Holder (collectively, the “Cleansing Material”) upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Cleansing Material attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto was prepared as of an earlier date and is being furnished in satisfaction of the Company’s public disclosure obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.
The information set forth in this Current Report on Form 8-K (this “Current Report”) and the exhibit attached hereto are not an offer to sell or exchange, or solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities, or a solicitation of consents with respect to any securities.
The information included in this Current Report under Item 7.01 and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto is being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to liabilities of that Section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings.
Cautionary Note Information Regarding Projections
The financial projections, prospective financial information and forecasts (collectively, the “Projections”) included in the Cleansing Material were not prepared with a view towards public disclosure or compliance with the published guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or the guidelines established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board for the presentation and preparation of “prospective financial information.” The Company generally does not publicly disclose detailed prospective financial information. The Projections were prepared solely for the limited purpose of providing information in connection with the Company’s discussions about a Potential Transaction and should not be relied on to make an investment decision with respect to the Company.
The Projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s management. The Projections do not purport to present the Company’s financial condition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountant has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections and, accordingly, none has expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability and none assumes any responsibility for the Projections.
The inclusion of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that the Company or any other person considered, or now consider, the Projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and does
not constitute an admission or representation by any person that the expectations, beliefs, opinions, and assumptions that underlie such forecasts remain the same as of the date of this Current Report, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information.
The estimates and assumptions underlying the Projections are subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company and may not prove to be accurate. The Projections also do not reflect future changes in general business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that may occur and that was not anticipated at the time this information was prepared. The Projections are not, and should not be regarded as, a representation that any of the expectations contained in, or forming a part of, the Projections will be achieved. The Projections are forward-looking in nature. Further, the Projections relate to multiple future years and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding day.
The Projections include non-GAAP financial measures, as described in the Cleansing Material.
The Company cannot provide a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financials measures included in the Projections and the most directly comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items required for the reconciliation.
These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report contains forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as estimates, forecasts, and projections about possible or assumed future results of the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans, and objectives and the Company’s industry and market growth. Actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, ongoing uncertainty in global economic and geopolitical conditions, such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East; changes in progress on infrastructure development or changes in customer or industrial demand that could negatively affect product demand, including as a result of an economic slowdown or recession; collectability of receivables and other related matters if consumers and businesses defer purchases or payments, or default on payments; risks associated with expansion plans, including design and construction delays, cost overruns; the timing and amount of government incentives actually received, including, among other things, any direct grants and tax credits; issues in installing and qualifying new equipment and ramping production; poor production process yields and quality control, and potential increases to the Company’s restructuring costs; the Company’s ability to obtain additional funding, including, among other things, from government funding, public or private equity offerings, or debt financings, on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all; the Company’s ability to take certain actions with respect to its capital and debt structure, including issuing the full amount of senior notes under its agreements with lenders and restructuring or refinancing its convertible notes; the risk that the Company does not meet its production commitments to those customers who provide it with capacity reservation deposits or similar payments; the risk that the Company may experience production difficulties that preclude it from shipping sufficient quantities to meet customer orders or that result in higher production costs, lower yields and lower margins; the Company’s ability to lower costs; the risk that its results will suffer if the Company is unable to balance fluctuations in customer demand and capacity, including bringing on additional capacity on a timely basis to meet customer demand or scaling
back its manufacturing expenses or overhead costs quickly enough to correspond to lower than expected demand; the risk that longer manufacturing lead times may cause customers to fulfill their orders with a competitor’s products instead; product mix; risks associated with the ramp-up of production of new products, and entry into new business channels different from those in which the Company has historically operated; the Company’s ability to convert customer design-ins to design-wins and sales of significant volume, and, if customer design-in activity does result in such sales, when such sales will ultimately occur and what the amount of such sales will be; the risk that the markets for the Company’s products will not develop as it expects, including the adoption of its products by electric vehicle manufacturers and the overall adoption of electric vehicles; the risk that the economic and political uncertainty caused by the tariffs imposed or announced by the United States on imported goods, and corresponding tariffs and other retaliatory measures imposed by other countries (including China) in response, may continue to negatively impact demand for the Company’s products; the risk that Wolfspeed or its channel partners are not able to develop and expand customer bases and accurately anticipate demand from end customers, including production and product mix, which can result in increased inventory and reduced orders as the Company experiences wide fluctuations in supply and demand; risks related to international sales and purchases; risks resulting from the concentration of business among few customers, including the risk that customers may reduce or cancel orders or fail to honor purchase commitments; the risk that the Company’s investments may experience periods of significant market value and interest rate volatility causing it to recognize fair value losses on its investment; the risk posed by managing an increasingly complex supply chain (including managing the impacts of supply constraints in the semiconductor industry and meeting purchase commitments under take-or-pay arrangements with certain suppliers) that has the ability to supply a sufficient quantity of raw materials, subsystems and finished products with the required specifications and quality; risks relating to outbreaks of infectious diseases or similar public health events, including the risk of disruptions to the Company’s operations, supply chain, including its contract manufacturers, or customer demand; the risk the Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if its remaining goodwill or amortizable assets become impaired; risks relating to confidential information theft or misuse, including through cyber attacks or cyber intrusion; the Company’s ability to complete development and commercialization of products under development; the rapid development of new technology and competing products that may impair demand or render its products obsolete; the potential lack of customer acceptance for the Company’s products; risks associated with ongoing litigation; the risk that customers do not maintain their favorable perception of the Company’s brand and products, resulting in lower demand for its products; the risk that the Company’s products fail to perform or fail to meet customer requirements or expectations, resulting in significant additional costs; risks associated with strategic transactions; the risk that the Company is not able to successfully execute or achieve the potential benefits of its efforts to enhance its value; the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and other factors discussed in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including its report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements represent the Company’s judgment as of the date of this Current Report. Except as required under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Current Report, whether as a result of new information, future events, developments, changes in assumptions or otherwise.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 8, 2025, the Company entered into a sales agreement (“Sales Agreement”) with TD Securities (USA) LLC (“TD Cowen”) to sell shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), having an aggregate offering price of up to $119.0 million, from time to time, through an “at the market offering” program under which TD Cowen will act as sales agent.
Immediately prior to entering into the Sales Agreement, the Company terminated its sales agreement, dated August 4, 2022, between the Company and TD Cowen (as successor to Cowen and Company, LLC) (the “Prior Sales Agreement”). As of the termination of the Prior Sales Agreement, the Company had sold an aggregate of approximately 4.9 million shares of Common Stock under the Prior Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $30.6 million, resulting in an unsold aggregate offering price of approximately $119.4 million. Following the termination of the Prior Sales Agreement, the Company may not offer or sell any additional shares of Common Stock under the Prior Sales Agreement or the related prospectus, dated May 1, 2023.
Under the Sales Agreement, the Company will set the parameters for the sale of shares of Common Stock, including the number or dollar amount of shares to be issued, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, any limitation on the number or dollar amount of shares that may be sold in any one trading day, and any minimum price below which sales may not be made. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, TD Cowen may sell the shares in negotiated transactions, including block trades or block sales, or by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including without limitation sales made through the Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other trading market for the Common Stock, or by any method permitted by law. TD Cowen has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts in conducting such sales activities consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations, and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. As specified in the Sales Agreement, the Sales Agreement may be terminated by the Company upon written notice to TD Cowen for any reason or by TD Cowen upon written notice to the Company for any reason or at any time under certain circumstances, including in the event of a material adverse change in the Company, subject to the terms of the Sales Agreement.
The Sales Agreement provides that TD Cowen will be entitled to compensation for its services of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sales of shares of Common Stock through TD Cowen under the Sales Agreement. The Company has no obligation to sell any shares under the Sales Agreement, and may at any time suspend sales of shares under the Sales Agreement. The Sales Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and agreements by the Company, indemnification obligations of the Company and TD Cowen, other obligations of the parties, and termination provisions.
On May 8, 2025, the Company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a prospectus supplement (“Prospectus Supplement”) under the Company’s effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-277584) (as amended, “Registration Statement”) in connection with the offer and sale of shares of its Common Stock under the Sales Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Sales Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (“Current Report”) and incorporated herein by reference.
A copy of the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. relating to the validity of the shares of Common Stock to be sold under the Sales Agreement is filed as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report and is hereby incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.
This Current Report does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the shares of Common Stock discussed herein, nor shall there be any sale of such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Forward-Looking Statements
This Report includes statements that express our management’s opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, “forward-looking statements”. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “seeks,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will” or “should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Report, including, but not limited to, statements relating to the anticipated benefits of our rebranding, our strategic alliances with third parties, our recent executive hires and elected directors, and our debt refinancing; our 2025 outlook and guidance; and the long-term prospects of the Company. Such forward-looking statements reflect management’s expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, operational and financial performance and business prospects and opportunities. Such forward-looking statements are based on available current market information and management’s expectations, beliefs and forecasts concerning future events impacting the business. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that these forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. These factors include: loss of our clients, particularly our largest clients; the ability to achieve the goals of our strategic plans and recognize the anticipated strategic, operational, growth and efficiency benefits when expected; our ability to enter new lines of business and broaden the scope of our services; the loss of key members of our management team or inability to maintain sufficient qualified personnel; our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain a large number of skilled employees, and adapt to the effects of inflationary pressure on wages; trends in the U.S. healthcare system, including recent trends of unknown duration of reduced healthcare utilization and increased patient financial responsibility for services; effects of competition;
effects of pricing pressure; the inability of our clients to pay for our services; changes in our industry and in industry standards and technology; adverse outcomes related to litigation or governmental proceedings; interruptions or security breaches of our information technology systems and other cybersecurity attacks; our ability to maintain the licenses or right of use for the software we use; our ability to protect proprietary information, processes and applications; our inability to expand our network infrastructure; inability to preserve or increase our existing market share or the size of our preferred provider organization networks; decreases in discounts from providers; pressure to limit access to preferred provider networks; changes in our regulatory environment, including healthcare law and regulations; the expansion of privacy and security laws; heightened enforcement activity by government agencies; our ability to obtain additional financing; our ability to pay interest and principal on our notes and other indebtedness; lowering or withdrawal of our credit ratings; changes in accounting principles or the incurrence of impairment charges; the possibility that we may be adversely affected by other political, economic, business, and/or competitive factors; other factors disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings; and other factors beyond our control.
The forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and potential effects on our business. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting our business will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those under “Risk Factors” therein, and other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by us. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws."

The Amendment provides for, among other things, (i) the establishment of a delayed draw term loan (the “Term Loan”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75,000,000 that may be drawn prior to February 28, 2026 for the sole purpose of paying  amounts outstanding under the 0.75% convertible senior notes due February 1, 2026 and customary fees and expenses in connection therewith, (ii) a reduction in the aggregate principal amount available under the existing revolving line of credit (the “Revolving Line”) to $25,000,000, (iii) an adjustment of the financial covenants set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, (iv) an extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Line to May 1, 2030, and (v) an adjustment to the interest rate margins applicable to advances. The Term Loan and the Revolving Line both mature on May 1, 2030. Commencing on April 1, 2026, the Borrower must make amortization payments on any advances under the Term Loan at the percentages set forth in the Amendment.
Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to (a) term SOFR plus a specified margin or (b) WSJ prime plus a specified margin, in each case which will be adjusted based on the Company’s net leverage ratio at the time of borrowing. Borrower must also pay the Bank (i) a commitment fee of $125,000 and (ii) an “Unused Revolving Line Facility Fee” of 0.25% per annum of the average unused portion of the Revolving Line.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, and negative and affirmative covenants customary for transactions of this type. These include covenants limiting the ability of Borrower, and any of their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, to, among other things, (i) incur indebtedness, (ii) incur liens on their assets, (iii) enter into any merger or consolidation with, or acquire all or substantially all of the equity or property of, another person, (iv) dispose of any of their business or property, (v) make or permit any payment on subordinated debt, or (vi) pay any dividend, make any other distribution, or redeem any equity.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default and also provides that an event of default includes any default resulting in a right by third parties to accelerate maturity of indebtedness in excess of $500,000. If any event of default occurs and is not cured within applicable grace periods set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement or waived, all loans and other obligations could become due and immediately payable and the facility could be terminated. In addition, Borrower may be required to deposit cash with the Bank in an amount equal to 105% of any undrawn letters of credit denominated in U.S. Dollars or 115% of any undrawn letters of credit denominated in a foreign currency.

OPAL,0001628280-25-023886,2025-05-08,"2.02, 9.01","Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 8, 2025, OPAL Fuels Inc. (the ""Company"")  issued a press release regarding its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
The information disclosed under this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, is being ""furnished"" and shall not be deemed ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of such section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. By filing this Current Report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, the Company makes no statement or admission as to the materiality of any information in this Item 2.02 or the exhibit attached hereto.
This Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward looking statements are based on current expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. Further, the forward-looking statements are subject to the limitations listed in Exhibit 99.1 and in the other SEC reports of the Company, including that actual events or results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
Additionally, to supplement the Company’s  financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") in Exhibit 99.1, the Company uses a non-GAAP financial measure that it calls adjusted EBITDA (""Adjusted EBITDA""). This non-GAAP financial measure adjusts net income for interest and financing expense, net, net (income) loss attributable to non-redeemable non-controlling interests, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, adjustments to reflect Adjusted EBITDA from equity method investments, unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, non-cash charges, one-time non-recurring charges, major maintenance on Renewable Power, RNG development costs, virtual pipeline costs, and ITC proceeds, net. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information about the Company’s performance, for the following reasons: (1) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to assess the Company’s operating performance and make financial and operational decisions; (2) the measure excludes the effect of items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business; (3) the measure better aligns revenues with expenses; and (4) the measure is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company’s business. In future quarters, the Company may adjust for other expenditures, charges or gains to present non-GAAP financial measures that the Company’s management believes are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance.
Non-GAAP financial measures are limited as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s GAAP results. The Company expects to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures, adjusting for the items described above (and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Company’s management deems appropriate), and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses, charges or gains like the non-GAAP adjustments described above. Accordingly, unless expressly stated otherwise, the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. Moreover, because not all companies use identical measures and calculations, the Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the exhibit.

Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously announced, on August 9, 2022, atai Life Sciences N.V. (the “Company”), atai Life Sciences AG (“atai AG”) and certain of the
Company’s subsidiary guarantors (together with the Company and atai AG, the “Borrower”) entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (such Loan and Security Agreement, as amended from time to time, the “Hercules Loan Agreement”) with Hercules Capital,
Inc. (“Hercules”), as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other lenders signatory thereto.
On May 2, 2025, the Borrower and Hercules entered into a payoff letter for a voluntary prepayment with respect to the Hercules Loan
Agreement (the “Payoff Letter”).  Pursuant to the Payoff Letter, on May 2, 2025 (the “Payoff Date”), the Borrower paid off the outstanding loan amount of approximately $21.8 million in full in repayment of the Company’s outstanding obligations under
the Hercules Loan Agreement, and thereby terminated the Hercules Loan Agreement.  Under the terms of the Hercules Loan Agreement the Borrower was required to begin loan amortization payments on September 1, 2025 with a maturity date of August 1,
2026. Due to the early prepayment, the Borrower incurred a prepayment fee equal to 0.50% of the outstanding principal balance for a total of $0.1 million, which was offset by a savings of approximately $2.1 million of interest due under the full
amortization payment schedule. In addition, regardless of early prepayment, the Borrower was obligated to pay an end of charge term equal to 6.95% of the outstanding principal balance for a total of $1.4 million. The Hercules Loan Agreement was
secured by a lien on substantially all of the Borrower’s assets, with certain limited exceptions set forth in the Hercules Loan Agreement. Hercules released and terminated all liens or security interests granted to secure the obligations under the
Hercules Loan Agreement and the Borrower was released from its guaranties and obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement and related loan documents (other than with respect to customary provisions and agreements that are expressly specified to
survive the termination).
The foregoing description of the Hercules Loan Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the Hercules Loan Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, and amendments thereto, filed as Exhibit 10.27 to the Company’s Annual Report

MG,0001436126-25-000031,2025-05-08,"2.02, 9.01","Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 7, 2025, Mistras Group, Inc. (the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"") issued a press release announcing the financial results for our first quarter of 2025, which ended March 31, 2025. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In the press release attached, the Company uses the terms “Adjusted EBITDA,” “free cash flow,” ""net debt"" and ""net income before special items,"" which are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The tables to the press release include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure under GAAP. Also, in the tables to the press release, the non-GAAP financial measures ""Segment and Total Company Income (Loss) before Special Items” (which includes operating income (loss) before special items) are presented and reconciled to financial measures under GAAP within the table ""Segment and Total Company Income (Loss) from Operations (GAAP) to Income (Loss) from Operations before Special Items (Non-GAAP)."" The non-GAAP financial measure ""Diluted EPS excluding Special Items,"" is presented and reconciled to the financial measure under GAAP within the table ""Net Income (Loss) (GAAP) and Diluted EPS (GAAP) to Net Income (Loss) Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP) and Diluted EPS Excluding Special Items (Non-GAAP)."" Information about these non-GAAP financial measures are included in the press release.
Our management uses and provides these non-GAAP financial measures as a measure of operating performance and liquidity to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations for the Company and for evaluating actual results against such expectations. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are also performance evaluation metrics used to determine incentive compensation for the Company's executive officers.
We believe that investors and other users of the financial statements benefit from the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures because they provide additional metrics to compare the Company's operating performance and liquidity on a consistent basis and measure underlying trends and results of the Company's business. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income before special items assist in evaluating our operating performance because they remove the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. For instance, Adjusted EBITDA generally excludes interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization, each of which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value and age of assets, capital structure, capital investment cycles and the method by which assets were acquired. It also eliminates stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense and is excluded by management when evaluating the underlying performance of our business operations.
Our management uses free cash flow when evaluating the performance of our business operations. This financial measure also takes into account cash used to purchase fixed assets needed for business operations which are not expensed. We believe this financial measure provides an additional tool to compare cash generated by our operations on a consistent basis and measure underlying trends and results in our business.
While Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are terms and financial measures commonly used by investors and securities analysts, they have limitations. As non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flows have no standard meaning and, therefore, may not be comparable with similar financial measures for other companies. Similarly, segment and total company income before special items and diluted EPS excluding special items has no standard meaning and may not be comparable to financial measures for other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are generally limited as analytical tools because they exclude charges and expenses we do incur as part of our operations as well as cash uses which are included in a GAAP cash flow statement. In addition, free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since items such as debt repayments are not deducted in determining such measure.
None of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.

Important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the amount, timing, and sources of funding for the Company’s repurchase program, the fact that common share repurchases may not be conducted in the timeframe or in the manner the Company expects, or at all, the ability of the Company to obtain the funding required to pay certain Meridianbet Group acquisition post-closing obligations, the terms of such funding, potential dilution caused thereby and/or covenants agreed to in connection therewith; potential lawsuits regarding the acquisition; dilution caused by the terms of outstanding convertible notes and warrants, the Company’s ability to pay amounts due under convertible notes and covenants associated therewith and penalties which could be due under the convertible notes and securities purchase agreement related thereto for failure to comply with the terms thereof; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which the Company operates; the effect on the Company and its operations of the ongoing Ukraine/Russia conflict and the conflict in Israel, changing interest rates and inflation, and risks of recessions; the need for additional financing, the terms of such financing and the availability of such financing; the ability of the Company and/or its subsidiaries to obtain additional gaming licenses; the ability of the Company to manage growth; the Company’s ability to complete acquisitions and the availability of funding for such acquisitions; disruptions caused by acquisitions; dilution caused by fund raising, the conversion of outstanding preferred stock, convertible securities and/or acquisitions; the Company’s ability to maintain the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market; the Company’s expectations for future growth, revenues, and profitability; the Company’s expectations regarding future plans and timing thereof; the Company’s reliance on its management; the fact that the sellers of the Meridianbet Group hold voting control over the Company; related party relationships; the potential effect of economic downturns, recessions, increases in interest rates and inflation, and market conditions, decreases in discretionary spending and therefore demand for our products and services, and increases in the cost of capital, related thereto, among other affects thereof, on the Company’s operations and prospects; the Company’s ability to protect proprietary information; the ability of the Company to compete in its market; the effect of current and future regulation, the Company’s ability to comply with regulations and potential penalties in the event it fails to comply with such regulations and changes in the enforcement and interpretation of existing laws and regulations and the adoption of new laws and regulations that may unfavorably impact our business; the risks associated with gaming fraud, user cheating and cyber-attacks; risks associated with systems failures and failures of technology and infrastructure on which the Company’s programs rely; foreign exchange and currency risks; the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings in the normal course of business; the ability to compete against existing and new competitors; the ability to manage expenses associated with sales and marketing and necessary general and administrative and technology investments; and general consumer sentiment and economic conditions that may affect levels of discretionary customer purchases of the Company’s products, including potential recessions and global economic slowdowns. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by the forward-looking statements we make in this press release are reasonable, we provide no assurance that these plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved.
Other important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements included in this communication are described in the Company’s publicly-filed reports, including, but not limited to, under the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s periodic and current filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Qs and Form 10-Ks, including, but not limited to, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024  and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 and future periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10‑Q.

As of May 6, 2025, enrollment into cohorts 1, 2 and 3 has been completed for a total of 48
patients. The data covers 32 patients receiving soquelitinib and 12 placebos with 28-day follow-up, and four additional patients receiving
soquelitinib with 15-day follow-up from cohort 3. These four patients have not yet completed the 28-day treatment course.
Baseline patient characteristics are shown below in Table 1. Patients enrolled in cohort 3
had more severe disease with higher mean baseline EASI scores compared to cohorts 1 and 2. A higher proportion also failed prior systemic
therapies. Across all cohorts, the mean EASI scores are 22.3 and 21.2 for active and placebo, respectively. Placebo (n=12) and active
(n=36) treatment groups were well-balanced with regard to baseline characteristics.
Table 1: Patient Characteristics
The percent reduction in mean EASI scores at 28 days for the combined cohort 1 and 2 group was
54.6% for patients receiving soquelitinib and 30.6% for patients receiving placebo. In cohort 3, the percent reduction in mean EASI score
at 28 days was 71.1% for patients receiving soquelitinib and 42.1% for patients receiving placebo.
Figure 1 below shows the percent of patients that achieved IGA 0 or 1 or EASI 75 at day 28 of
treatment. The placebo patients from cohort 1 (n=4), cohort 2 (n=4) and cohort 3 (n=4) are combined, with no placebo patients achieving
IGA 0 or 1 or EASI 75. IGA 0 or 1 and EASI 75 have been determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to be clinically meaningful and approvable endpoints and have been the endpoints used in clinical trials for other FDA approved treatments
for atopic dermatitis.

Treatment
The graphs below (Figures 2 and 3) show the kinetics of response for each of the cohorts and
for the combined cohorts 1, 2 and 3. The placebo patients (n=12) are combined in both graphs. Separation of the curves for patients receiving
active drug began at day 15 and increased by day 28 for cohorts 1 and 2. Cohort 3 patients experienced earlier and deeper separation from
placebo starting by day 8. The combined soquelitinib treatment group is significantly superior to placebo at day 28, p=0.03.
Figure 2: Percent Reduction in Mean EASI Score for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3.
Mean percent
change in EASI score over time is shown. Treatment beginning is designated “Baseline” and days post-baseline are shown. Screening
to baseline data is shown and demonstrates relative disease stability. The study blinding remains in effect for the entire 58-day period.
Numbers at the top of the graphs indicate numbers of patients evaluated at the various time points.
Figure 3: Percent Reduction in Mean EASI Score for Combined Cohorts 1, 2 and 3
.
The
data is displayed below with cohorts combined. Four active patients in cohort 3 have not yet reached day 28 of treatment.
Safety Data
Soquelitinib was well tolerated, with no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and no clinically significant
laboratory abnormalities observed in any of the cohorts. No interruption of drug dosing was seen in any of the cohorts. Grade 1/2 adverse
events (treatment related and unrelated) were seen in 33.3% of patients receiving soquelitinib and 25% receiving placebo. Only one treatment
related adverse event of grade 1 nausea was reported with soquelitinib treatment.
Serum Cytokine and Other Biomarker Studies
As reported previously, relationships between reductions in certain cytokines with improvement
in EASI scores were observed. Reductions in serum cytokine levels were seen for IL-5, IL-9, IL-17, IL-31, IL-33, TSLP and TARC. Differences
between responding and non-responding patients were found, while no such relationships were seen in the placebo group. Increasing trends
were seen in numbers of circulating T regulatory cells, consistent with the presumed mechanism of action of soquelitinib.
Soquelitinib Atopic Dermatitis Phase 1 Clinical Trial Design and Protocol Update
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial was designed
to enroll 64 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that previously failed one prior topical or systemic therapy. Patients
were planned to be enrolled into one of four dosing cohorts in a 3:1 ratio (12 active and four placebo) to receive either soquelitinib
or placebo. The cohorts are sequentially enrolled and will examine 100 mg orally twice per day, 200 mg orally once per day, 200 mg orally
twice per day and 400 mg orally once per day. Patients are treated for 28 days and are then followed for an additional 30 days with no
therapy. The Company amended the clinical trial protocol to replace cohort 4 (400 mg once per day) with 24 patients randomized 1:1 between
active and placebo. Treatment for this group will be extended to 8 weeks with additional 30-day follow-up with no treatment. The dose
level for this group is planned to be the same as cohort 3 – 200 mg orally twice per day.
These doses were selected based on the Company’s prior experience evaluating soquelitinib
in T cell lymphoma patients. The doses in the atopic dermatitis trial studied in cohorts 1 and 2 are lower than the 200 mg orally twice
a day dosing regimen (same dose as cohort 3 of the atopic dermatitis trial), which is the level that has been shown to provide complete
ITK occupancy and that is being evaluated in the Company’s ongoing registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of soquelitinib in peripheral
T cell lymphoma.
The primary endpoints include safety and tolerability. Efficacy, measured by improvement in EASI score
and IGA, are secondary endpoints. Reduction in itch and various cytokine biomarkers are exploratory endpoints. EASI scores are
also evaluated by the percent of patients that achieve a specified percent reduction in EASI score – EASI 50
for patients that achieved a 50% reduction; EASI 75 for a 75% reduction; and EASI 90 for a 90% reduction. Corvus and
a data monitoring committee monitor the data from the trial as the trial progresses.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements
related to the potential safety and efficacy of soquelitinib and the Company’s conduct of and monitoring of data from clinical trials.
All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K are forward-looking statements. These
statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,”“estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond the Company’s control.
The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number
of factors, including but not limited to, risks detailed in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended
March 31, 2025, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about the date hereof, as well as other documents that may be
filed by the Company from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, the following factors, among others,
could cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements: the Company’s ability
to demonstrate sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety in its clinical trials of its product candidates; the accuracy of the Company’s
estimates relating to its ability to initiate and/or complete preclinical studies and clinical trials and release data from such studies
and clinical trials; the results of preclinical studies and interim data from clinical trials not being predictive of future results;
the Company’s ability to enroll sufficient numbers of patients in its clinical trials; the unpredictability of the regulatory process;
regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; the costs of clinical trials may exceed expectations; and the Company’s
ability to raise additional capital. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, it cannot guarantee that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur,
and the timing of events and circumstances and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All such statements speak only as of the date made,
and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on
Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements
involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to possible or assume future results of our business,
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, plans and objectives. You can generally identify forward-looking statements because
they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,”“could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,”“estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other
similar expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
on our current expectations and projections regarding future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties
and other factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (333-278629)
(the “Registration Statement”), and elsewhere in the Registration Statement. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking
statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking
statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those projected in the
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K include, but are not limited to, statements
regarding: the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate; our ability to successfully implement our business strategy,
effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings
of such strategies and actions; our ability to recruit and retain qualified driving associates, independent contractors and third-party
auto transportation and logistics companies; an increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or other claims; our expectations regarding
the successful implementation of our acquisitions; geopolitical developments and additional changes in international trade policies and
relations; the effect of any international conflicts or terrorist activities, on the United States and global economies in general, the
transportation industry, or us in particular, and what effects these events will have on our costs and the demand for our services; our
ability to manage our network capacity and cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses, and match it to shifting and
future customer volume levels; our ability to compete effectively against current and future competitors; our ability to maintain our
profitability despite quarterly fluctuations in our results, whether due to seasonality, large cyclical events, or other causes; and our
future financial and operating results; our expectations regarding the period during which we will qualify as an emerging growth company
under the JOBS Act; and our use of the net proceeds from the IPO and the sufficiency of our existing cash to fund our future operating
expenses and capital expenditure requirements.
The forward-looking statements
made in this Current Report on Form 8-K relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect
the occurrence of unanticipated events. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking
statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash and certain other special charges that many investors believe may obscure the user’s overall understanding of ISG’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future.  ISG believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of the financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency of key measures used to evaluate the Company’s performance.​ISG provides adjusted EBITDA (defined as net income, plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, non-cash stock compensation, interest accretion associated with contingent consideration, acquisition and disposition-related cost,  and severance, integration and other expense), adjusted net income (defined as net income, plus amortization of intangible assets, non-cash stock compensation, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, interest accretion associated with contingent consideration, acquisition and disposition-related cost, and severance, integration, and other expense on a tax-adjusted basis), adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA margin and selected financial data on a constant currency basis which are non-GAAP measures that the Company believes provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and financial implications of foreign currency translations, which management believes are not indicative of ISG’s core operations. These non-GAAP measures are used by ISG to evaluate the Company’s business strategies and management’s performance.​Non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely applicable GAAP measure.  Non-GAAP measures are provided as additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.​ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS​(d)

On May 2, 2025, Dean Owner LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Dean Owner”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clipper Realty Inc. (the “Company”), entered into the Multifamily Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with MF1 Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MF1 Capital”), dated as of May 2, 2025. In addition, on May 2, 2025, Dean Member LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Dean Member”) and MF1 Capital entered into the Mezzanine Multifamily Loan and Security Agreement (the “Mezzanine Loan Agreement” and together with the Loan Agreement, the “New Loan Agreements”) with MF1 Capital, a company not affiliated with the Company dated as of May 2, 2025.
The Loan Agreement provides for the $115 million loan to Dean Owner, and the Mezzanine Loan Agreement provides for the $45 million loan to Dean Member (collectively, the “Loans”). The Loans have an initial May 2027 maturity date, with three one-year extensions available upon meeting the applicable extension conditions, and bear interest at 2.65% rate, plus 1-Month CME Term SOFR (with a floor of 2.25%). The Dean Member can borrow up to an additional $18.2 million under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement based on meeting various performance targets over the term of the loan. Under the Loan Agreement, the Company deposited with MF1 Capital (i) $4.3 million for a shortfall reserve account to pay interest and operating expenses during the initial lease up period of the Dean Street Property, and (ii) $1.6 million for completion reserve deposits towards the completion of the construction of the building.
The New Loan Agreements also contain customary representations, covenants, and events of default.
In addition, the Company purchased an interest rate cap with US Bank that caps the SOFR portion of the interest rate on the Loans at 6%.
On May 2, 2025, concurrently with entering into the Loan Agreements, the Company repaid its loans under: (i) the Credit Agreement by and among Dean Owner, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Valley National Bank, as Administrative Agent, dated as of August 10, 2023 (the “Credit Agreement”), and (ii) the Mezzanine Loan Agreement, dated as of August 10, 2023, by and among BADF 953 Dean Street Lender LLC, as Administrative Agent, the lenders party hereto, and Dean Member, as borrower (the “Mezzanine Agreement” and together with the Credit Agreement, “Prior Loan Agreements”). The Prior Loan Agreements provided for a $115.0 million senior loans under the Credit Agreement and $8.0 million note under the Mezzanine Agreement, which the Company used as construction loans related to its Dean Street Property. In connection with entering into the New Loan Agreements, the Prior Loan Agreements were terminated (pursuant to the terms therein), whereby the borrowers paid to the lenders approximately $126 million of principal and accrued interest outstanding under the Prior Loan Agreements.
The Company incurred no fees or costs as a result of the termination of the Prior Loan Agreements, and the Company incurred approximately $3.1 million in closing costs for the New Loan Agreements.
The foregoing description of the New Loan Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the New Loan Agreements, which will be filed as exhibits to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2025 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 8, 2025, Clarus Corporation (the “Company”)
issued a press release announcing results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025 (the “Press Release”). A copy of the
Press Release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein
by reference is a presentation regarding the Company’s financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025 (the “Presentation”).
The Press Release and/or the Presentation contains
the non-GAAP measures: (i) adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, (ii) adjusted (loss) income from continuing operations and
related earnings (loss) per diluted share, (iii) earnings before interest, taxes, other income or expense, depreciation and amortization
(“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin, and (iv) free cash flow (defined as net cash provided
by operating activities less capital expenditures). The Company believes that the presentation of certain non-GAAP measures, i.e.: (i)
adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, (ii) adjusted (loss) income from continuing operations and related earnings (loss) per
diluted share, (iii) EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, and (iv) free cash flow, provide useful information
for the understanding of its ongoing operations and enables investors to focus on period-over-period operating performance, and thereby
enhances the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance relative to past performance and
provides, along with the nearest GAAP measures, a baseline for modeling future earnings expectations. Non-GAAP measures are reconciled
to comparable GAAP financial measures within the Press Release and the Presentation. We do not provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP
guidance measures adjusted EBITDA and/or adjusted EBITDA margin for the fiscal year 2025 to net income for the fiscal year 2025, the most
comparable GAAP financial measure, due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting certain types of expenses and gains, without unreasonable
effort, which affect net income but not adjusted EBITDA and/or adjusted EBITDA margin. The Company cautions that non- GAAP measures should
be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported GAAP results. Additionally, the Company notes
that there can be no assurance that the above referenced non-GAAP financial measures are comparable to similarly titled financial measures
used by other publicly traded companies.
The information in Item 2.02 of this Current Report
on Form 8-K (including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2) shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 7, 2025, AMVAC Chemical Corporation (“AMVAC”), principal operating subsidiary of American Vanguard Corporation (“Registrant” or the “Company”), as borrower, and affiliates (including Registrant), as guarantors and/or borrowers, entered into Amendment Number Ten (the “Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with a group of commercial lenders led by BMO Bank, N.A. (successor to the Bank of the West), as administrative agent for the lenders.
The Amendment extends the due date by which the Registrant is required to deliver to the agent and lenders under the Loan Agreement the Registrant’s annual audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 from 120 days to 150 days following the end of the fiscal year and the Registrant’s quarterly unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025 from 45 days to 60 days following the end of such fiscal quarter. The Amendment did not change the
90-day
period for any future fiscal year nor the 45-day period for any future fiscal quarter. In connection with the Amendment, the Company received a waiver of an event of default under the Loan Agreement due to its failure to provide the annual audited financial statements within the previously extended due date of 120 days following the end of the fiscal year up from
90-days.
The Amendment also amended the amount of borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility by reducing that capacity by $60,000,000 through the Revolver Commitment Termination Date. This amendment changed the prior reduction in borrowing capacity pursuant to the Eighth Amendment dated on March 12, 2025, which had reduced the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility by $50,000,000 through June 30, 2025, $40,000,000 from July 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025, and $75,000,000 from January 1, 2026 through the Revolver Commitment Termination Date.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 8, 2025, Exagen Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) by and between Canaccord Genuity LLC (the “Underwriter”) relating to the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 3,350,000 shares (the “Firm Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), to the Underwriter at a price to the public of $5.25 per share (the “Offering”). Pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted to the Underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 502,500 shares of Common Stock in the Offering (the “Option Shares” and together with the Firm Shares, the “Shares”). The Offering is expected to close on May 9, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. All of the Shares in the Offering are being sold by the Company.
The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering are expected to be approximately $16.2 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering to acquire, in-license or invest in products, technologies or businesses that complement the Company’s business. However, the Company does not have binding agreements or commitments for any acquisitions or investments outside the ordinary course of business at this time.
The Shares are being offered and sold pursuant to a prospectus supplement, dated May 8, 2025 (the “Prospectus Supplement”), to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 8, 2025, and an accompanying base prospectus that forms a part of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-275632), which was previously filed with the SEC on November 17, 2023 and declared effective on November 29, 2023.
The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and also provides for customary indemnification obligations of the Company and the Underwriter, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Underwriting Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates and were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement. The foregoing summary of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement that is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., counsel to the Company, delivered an opinion as to legality of the issuance and sale of the Shares in the Offering, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to the amount of proceeds expected from the Offering, and the timing and certainty of completion of the Offering.

VOR,0001193125-25-115554,2025-05-08,"2.05, 5.02, 8.01, 9.01","Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On May 5, 2025, the board of directors of Vor Biopharma Inc. (the “Company”) approved the wind down of the Company’s clinical and manufacturing operations as the Company conducts a process to explore strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, which includes a plan to implement a reduction of the Company’s workforce by 147 full-time employees, or approximately 95% of the Company’s current employee base (the “Wind Down”). The total costs related to the Wind Down are estimated to be approximately $19.3 million. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $3.5 million in contract termination and other costs related to the discontinuation of its clinical trials, approximately $0.5 million in contract termination and other costs related to the exit from its manufacturing facility, an approximately $4.4 million loss on disposal of fixed assets, and approximately $10.9 million in costs related to the workforce reduction. The Company expects to complete the workforce reduction by the end of the second quarter of 2025 and to incur a significant majority of the costs related to the Wind Down in the second quarter of 2025. The Company may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the Wind Down. These estimates of the costs that the Company expects to incur, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
As part of the workforce reduction plan described above in Item 2.05, on May 8, 2025, the Company terminated the employment of Han Choi as Chief Financial Officer and Tirtha Chakraborty, PhD as Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Technical Operations, effective as of May 16, 2025 (the “Separation Date”), without cause.
In connection with their departures, the Company expects to enter into a separation agreement with each of Dr. Choi and Dr. Chakraborty (each, a “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Separation Agreements, each executive will receive a lump sum severance payment equal to ten months of his base salary in effect on the Separation Date, less applicable taxes and withholdings, and continuation of health coverage under COBRA for up to ten months. The Separation Agreements also will contain a general release of claims in favor of the Company.
The Company also expects to enter into a consulting agreement with Dr. Chakraborty pursuant to which he will provide transition services to the Company, subject to mutual agreement of terms.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 8, 2025, the Company issued a press release announcing that it is initiating a process to explore strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form
8-K
and is incorporated herein by reference.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Ligand Royalty Agreement
Amendment
In 2017, Elutia Med LLC (“Elutia
Med”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Elutia Inc. (the “Company” or “Elutia”) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated
(“Ligand”) entered into that certain royalty agreement dated as of May 31, 2017, as amended effective as of January 10,
2024 (the “Royalty Agreement”). The Royalty Agreement requires Elutia Med to pay Ligand 5.0% of future sales of the CanGaroo,
ProxiCor, Tyke and VasCure products, and substantially similar products, such as EluPro, through May 31, 2027, subject to annual
minimum payments of $4.4 million. Furthermore, a $5.0 million payment will be due if cumulative sales exceed $300 million or the assets
related to CanGaroo and any substantially similar products undergo a change of control during the ten-year term of the agreement, which
expires on May 31, 2027.
On May 8, 2025, the Company,
Elutia Med and Ligand entered into a subscription agreement and amendment no. 2 (the “Ligand Amendment”) to the Royalty Agreement.
The Ligand Amendment provides that $2.2 million in outstanding royalty obligations owed by Elutia Med to Ligand under the Royalty Agreement
will be satisfied by the issuance of 1,105,528 shares of Elutia’s Class A Common Stock (the “Shares”) to Ligand
in a transaction registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The royalty obligations being satisfied
through the issuance of Shares consist of all unpaid and accrued royalty payments under the Royalty Agreement as of May 8, 2025,
the date of execution of the Ligand Amendment, including monthly royalties, minimum quarterly royalties and minimum annual royalties,
all as such terms are defined in the Royalty Agreement. Such obligations would otherwise have had to been paid in cash.
The number of Shares issued
was determined by dividing royalty obligations of $2.2 million by $1.99, which is the average Nasdaq Official Closing Price of the Shares
(as reflected on Nasdaq.com) for the five trading days immediately preceding May 8, 2025, the day the Ligand Amendment was executed.
The Ligand Amendment does not amend, modify or otherwise affect Elutia Med’s royalty obligations under the Royalty Agreement with
respect to the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2025 and thereafter.
The Shares were offered by
the Company pursuant to a prospectus supplement to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-285870) originally filed
on March 18, 2025, with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and declared effective
on April 7, 2025.
The foregoing description
of the material terms of the Ligand Amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Ligand
Amendment, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 31, 2025.
The legal opinion, including
the related consent, of Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP relating to the legality of the issuance and sale of Shares is filed
as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report.
SWK Facility Amendment
On May 7, 2025, the Company
entered into a Fourth Amendment (the “SWK Amendment”) to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of August 10, 2022,
by and among the Company, as Borrower, SWK Funding LLC, as Agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto (the “Lenders”)
(as amended and supplemented from time to time, the “SWK Facility”). The SWK Facility provides for a senior secured term loan
in an aggregate amount of $25.0 million. The SWK Amendment, among other things: (i) allows for 100% of the interest payment due and
owing in May 2025 to be paid in kind, (ii) removed mandatory repayment obligations related to non-ordinary course asset sales
(any of such non-ordinary course asset sales to be approved in advance by the Lenders), (iii) allows the Company to request the Lender
to advance a new term loan in the amount of up to $5.0 million, which advance will be in the sole and absolute discretion of the Lenders,
(iv) fixed the amount of the minimum consolidated unencumbered liquid assets covenant to be at least $8.0 million and (v) provided
a pathway for the Company and the Agent to negotiate in good faith modifications to the repayment provisions in the event that there is
a material issuance by the Company of subordinated debt or equity interests.
In consideration for the SWK
Amendment, the Company has agreed to issue the Lenders 50,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock in a transaction exempt from registration
pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering and/or Regulation
D promulgated thereunder.
The foregoing description
of the material terms of the SWK Amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the SWK Amendment,
a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,

The disclosures set forth under Item 2.03 are incorporated by reference.
Item 2.03
Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
Pursuant to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “Charter”) of Bukit Jalil Global Acquisition 1 Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Company”), the Company currently has until June 30, 2024 to complete its initial business combination. However, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to June 30, 2025, each by an additional one-month extension, subject to Bukit Jalil Global Investment Ltd., a Cayman Islands company, the sponsor of the Company (the “Sponsor”) and/or its designee, depositing $100,000 (the “Monthly Extension Fee”) into the trust account of the Company (the “Trust Account”).
On or about May 1, 2025, an aggregate of $100,000 of the Monthly Extension Fee was deposited into the Trust Account for the Company’s public shareholders (the “Monthly Extension Payment”), which enables the Company to extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial business combination by one month from April 30, 2025 to May 30, 2025 (the “Extension”). The Extension is the eleventh of the twelve Monthly Extensions permitted under the Company’s Charter.
In connection with the Monthly Extension Payment, on May 6, 2025, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note of $100,000 (the “Note”) to the Sponsor.
The Note bears no interest and is payable in full upon the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the Company’s business combination or (ii) the date of expiry of the term of the Company (the “Maturity Date”). The following shall constitute an event of default: (i) a failure to pay the principal within five business days of the Maturity Date; (ii) the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy action, (iii) the breach of the Company’s obligations thereunder; (iv) any cross defaults; (v) an enforcement proceedings against the Company; and (vi) any unlawfulness and invalidity in connection with the performance of the obligations thereunder, in which case the Note may be accelerated.
The payees of the Note, the Sponsor, has the right, but not the obligation, to convert the Note, in whole or in part, respectively, into private units (the “Units”) of the Company, each consisting of one ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Ordinary Share”), one-half of one warrant, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of a business combination, as described in the prospectus of the Company (File No: 333- 272605), by providing the Company with written notice of the intention to convert at least two business days prior to the closing of the business combination. The number of Units to be received by the Sponsor in connection with such conversion shall be an amount determined by dividing (x) the sum of the outstanding principal amount payable to the Sponsor by (y) $10.00.
The issuance of the Note was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
A copy of the Note is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Note does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Note.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The information disclosed under Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02 to the extent required herein. The Units (and the underlying securities) issuable upon conversion of the Note, if any, (1) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferable or salable by the Sponsor until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination and (2) are entitled to registration rights.

At the Special Meeting, the following proposals were considered:
1.
Merger Agreement Proposal
.
A proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which provides that, among other things and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the parties thereto will consummate the Merger, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, pursuant to and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “Merger Agreement Proposal”).

the Company has been given 180 calendar days, or until October 29, 2025, to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Minimum Bid Price Requirement.
If at any time before October 29, 2025, the bid price of the Common Stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive

If the Company does not regain compliance with

The Company intends to monitor the closing bid
price of its Common Stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Minimum Bid Price Requirement,
including initiating a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with
the Nasdaq Minimum Bid Price Requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq Listing Rules."

Such statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such statements include statements regarding the Company’s strategy, future operations, prospects, plans, objectives of management, the expected timeline regarding the clinical development of product candidates, including the announcement of data, the potential activity and efficacy of product candidates in preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the timing and outcome of planned meetings with regulatory authorities.

The Company may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: uncertainties inherent in the development of product candidates, including the conduct of research activities, the initiation and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; uncertainties as to the availability and timing of results from preclinical studies and clinical trials; the timing of and the Company’s ability to submit and obtain regulatory approval for investigational new drug applications; whether results from preclinical studies will be predictive of the results of later preclinical studies and clinical trials; whether preliminary or interim data from a clinical trial will be predictive of the future results of the trial and future clinical trials; the Company’s ability to manage cash resources and obtain additional cash resources to fund the Company’s foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; as well as the risks and uncertainties identified in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and in subsequent filings the Company may make with the SEC.

Other Events.
As previously reported, on
November 25, 2024, Pluri Inc. (the “Company”) received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1),
which requires the Company to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders’ equity for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital
Market (the “Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”), nor was it in compliance with either of the alternative listing standards,
market value of listed securities of at least $35 million or net income of $500,000 from continuing operations in the most recently completed
fiscal year, or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years.
On January 6, 2025, the Company
submitted a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance (the “Compliance Plan”). Based on the Compliance Plan, Nasdaq granted the
Company an extension of time to regain compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement until May 24, 2025. On May 7, 2025,
the Company received a letter from Nasdaq, determining that the Company has regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(2), due to the
fact that for the 10 consecutive business days from April 22, 2025 through May 6, 2025, the market value of the Company’s listed
securities was $35 million or greater, satisfying the requirement under Rule 5550(b)(2). As a result, this matter is now closed, and the
Company remains in good standing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

On May 8, 2025, XBP Europe Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”)
announced that it had received notice from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) confirming that the Company had demonstrated
compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). Consequently, the Panel determined to continue the listing of the Company’s securities
on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) pertains to the continued listing requirements for companies on The Nasdaq
Capital Market (“NCM”), which requires that a company maintain a minimum market value of listed securities of at least $35
million.
As previously disclosed, on April 24, 2024, the Company received a
deficiency letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that the listing of its Common Stock was
not in compliance with the minimum $15 million market value of publicly held shares requirement (the “NGM MVPHS Requirement”)
for a period of 30 consecutive business days, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global
Market (the “NGM”). Due to the Company’s non-compliance with the NGM MVPHS Requirement, on September 4, 2024, the Company
requested to transfer the listing of its securities to the NCM.
On October 18, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the “Delisting
Determination Letter”) from Nasdaq stating that the Company had not regained compliance with the NGM MVPHS Requirement. The Company
subsequently requested a hearing before the Panel pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(d), which automatically stayed the suspension and/or delisting
of the Company’s securities pending the completion of the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted
by the Panel. At the Panel hearing on December 12, 2024, the Company reiterated its request to transfer to the NCM and presented a plan
to demonstrate compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) by achieving a market value of listed securities of at least $35 million no later
than April 4, 2025.
On January 13, 2025, Nasdaq notified the Company that the Panel had
granted the Company’s request to continue its application with the Nasdaq staff to transfer its securities to the NCM, provided
it demonstrated compliance with the minimum market value of listed securities requirement on or before April 4, 2025. The Company successfully
demonstrated compliance with this requirement and was informed on May 1, 2025, that it met the requirements of the NCM, thereby implying
that its application to transfer to the NCM had also been granted.

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On May 5, 2025, the Company
received a notification letter (the “Notice”)
from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the Company’s market value of publicly held shares (“MVPHS”), which value calculation under applicable Nasdaq rule excludes shares held by beneficial owners of more than 10% of our total shares outstanding and shares held by our officers and directors, closed below the $15,000,000 MVPHS threshold required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(3)(C).
The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until November 1, 2025, to regain compliance with the MVPHS requirement. To regain compliance, the Company’s MVPHS must close at or above $15,000,000 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days prior to the expiration of the 180-day compliance period. In the event that the Company does not regain compliance with the MVPHS requirement prior to the expiration of the 180-day compliance period, the Company will receive written notification from Nasdaq that the Company’s securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. Alternatively, the Company may apply to transfer its securities to The Nasdaq Capital Market, provided that the Company then meets the continued listing requirements on The Nasdaq Capital Market.
The Company intends to monitor its MVPHS and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options to regain compliance with the MVPHS requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the MVPHS requirement.

These statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict, which may cause actual events to be materially different from those expressed or implied herein. Statements about the Company’s intentions concerning its compliance with applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq are forward-looking statements. The Company has provided additional information about the risks facing its business and the Company in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and in its subsequent periodic and current reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, filed by it with the SEC.

On
April 30, 2025, the Board of Directors of MIRA Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“MIRA” or the “Company”) unanimously approved
a definitive agreement to acquire SKNY Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“SKNY”), a privately held biotechnology company developing
therapies targeting obesity and nicotine dependence. The acquisition follows the completion of independent third-party valuations conducted
by Moore Financial Consulting, which assigned SKNY an enterprise value of approximately $30.5 million and MIRA an enterprise value of
approximately $30 million.
As
part of the transaction, SKNY shall contribute an amount of assets or cash (or a combination of the two) totaling $5,000,000 to MIRA
at closing, with no contingencies. This capital infusion is expected to enhance MIRA’s balance sheet and support future development
initiatives.
The
combined enterprise value of over $60 million creates a stronger, more diversified platform positioned to address multiple high-value
markets with significant unmet need. The Company believes this transaction strengthens its strategic position by integrating complementary
assets, expanding its pipeline, and enhancing long-term shareholder value.
MIRA
is preparing to file a preliminary proxy statement on Form 14A with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to seek shareholder
approval of the transaction."

Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On April 25, 2025, VSee
Health, Inc. (the “Company”) received a notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department
(the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that the Company is not in compliance with
Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5250(c)(1)
as a result of its failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The Notice has no immediate
effect on the listing of the Company’s Common Stock (Nasdaq: VSEE) or the Company’s public warrants (Nasdaq: VSEEW) on Nasdaq.
The Notice informed the Company that, under Nasdaq rules, the Company has 60 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance, and
if the Staff accepts such plan, they can grant an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the Form 10-K’s due date (or until
October 13, 2025).
As previously reported in
the Company’s Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2025 (the “Form 12b-25”),
the Company was unable to file the Form 10-K within the prescribed period because additional time, resources and effort are required
to compile audited financial statements in connection with the de-SPAC merger closed in June 2024. Subsequent to filing the Form 12b-25,
the Company continued to dedicate significant resources to the completion of such compilation but was unable to file the Form 10-K
by April 15, 2025, the end of the extension period provided by the Form 12b-25. The Company requires additional time to complete
such compilation.
The
Company intends to take the necessary steps to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules as soon as practicable
and
currently expects to submit a plan of compliance with Nasdaq and/or file the Form 10-K within the 60-day period granted by Nasdaq
in the Notice. However, there can be no assurance that a plan of compliance will be submitted within such period, the Form 10-K will
be filed within such period, the Staff will grant the Company an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the Form 10-K’s
due date, or that the Company will be able meet the continued listing requirements during any compliance period that may be granted by
Nasdaq.
Forward-Looking Statements
This
Current Report on Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.
Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “projects,” “may,” “will,” “could,”“would,” “should,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,”“intends,” “plans,” “potential,” “promise” or similar references to future periods. Examples
of forward-looking statements in this current report include, without limitation, statements regarding the Company’s available options
to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical
facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based on the Company’s current beliefs, expectations and assumptions
regarding the future of its business, future plans, strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future
conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and actual
results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results
to differ include, without limitation, that there can be no assurance that the Company will file the Form 10-K or any plan of compliance
during any compliance period, that there can be no assurance that the Company will otherwise meet Nasdaq compliance standards, that there
can be no assurance that Nasdaq will grant the Company any relief from delisting as necessary or whether the Company can agree to or ultimately
meet applicable Nasdaq requirements for any such relief, and the other important factors described under the caption “Risk Factors”in the Company’s filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by the Company in this current report is based only on
information currently available and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by applicable law, the Company
expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time
to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise."

Letter
of Intent to Acquire Majority Ownership Stake in Dotcom Ventures Inc.
On
May 07, 2025, Lottery.com Inc. (collectively the “Company” or “Lottery.com”) entered into a Letter of Intent
(the “LOI”) with Dotcom Ventures Inc. (“DVI”) which outlines the intent of the Company to purchase
a minimum of 51% up to 100% of DVI and its assets including the domain names concerts.com and ticketstub.com (“DVI Assets”)
from Concerts.com Inc. (“Concerts.com” or the “Seller”).
Subject
to Due Diligence (as defined below), as consideration for Majority Interest, Lottery.com shall pay Concerts.com the purchase price of
Five Million Dollars USD ($5,000,000) (the “Purchase Price”) for Majority Interest in DVI. The parties mutually agree
that at Closing (as defined in Paragraph 11 herein), the Company shall have the option at its sole discretion to pay Concerts.com the
Purchase Price as follows: (i) in cash; (ii) as Payment-In-Kind (as defined below) equivalent to the Purchase Price; or (iii) a combination
of cash and Payment-In-Kind (as defined below) equivalent to the Purchase Price. The term “Payment-In-Kind” shall
be defined as restricted stock units of common shares of Lottery.com to be applied towards the Purchase Price
at
a
fixed price of Three Dollars USD ($3.00) per share (the “Fixed Price”) irrespective of the trading
price of Lottery.com stock at the execution of this LOI, the SPA or the Closing Date. At Closing, in the event that the Company elects
to make a Payment-In-Kind for any portion of the Purchase Price, the Company shall cause to be issued to Seller the equivalent in restricted
stock units of common shares in Lottery.com to be applied towards the Purchase Price. Seller shall receive the Payment-In-Kind within
three business days following the
Closing Date
. Any Payment-In-Kind
made as part of the consideration to satisfy any portion of the Purchase Price shall carry full piggyback registration rights for the
benefit of the Seller.
In
the event that the closing price of the restricted stock units of common shares in Lottery.com Inc. to be issued to the Seller as above
is lower than the Fixed Price on April 30, 2026 (the “Reprice Date”), then the Fixed Price shall be adjusted downward
to the VWAP of the common stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Reprice Date (the “Market
Price”). Accordingly, the Company shall be obligated to tender Seller additional restricted stock units of common shares in
Lottery.com Inc. to make up the difference between the Fixed Price and the Market Price.
The
Transaction contemplated by this LOI is subject to, among other things, the execution and delivery of a mutually agreeable agreement
(the “SPA”) containing the principal terms stated in the LOI and additional representations, warranties, covenants,
and other agreements that are customary for a transaction of this type.
Any
obligation for the Company to consummate the Transaction contemplated herein or pursuant to the SPA is subject to and conditioned upon
approval by a) the Company’s board of directors or b) the Company’s shareholders and obtaining Nasdaq, Security and Exchange
Commission or other regulatory approval or in compliance with all applicable governmental and quasi-governmental authorities.
Unless
otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in the SPA, the completion of the Transaction for Majority Interest of DVI shall occur on or
before August 1, 2025 and may take place remotely. It is currently anticipated that the execution of the SPA shall occur on or before
June 30, 2025."

Item 2.04

Cautionary Note Regarding the Company’s
Common Stock
The Company cautions that
trading in its common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices
for the Company’s common stock may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of the Company’s
common stock in the Chapter 11 Cases. In particular, the Company expects that holders of its common stock will experience a significant
or complete loss on their investment.

obligation to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 8-K or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events. The Company’s forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K include, but are not limited to, statements about
the Company’s plans to sell its assets pursuant to chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; the Company’s plans to obtain DIP financing;

statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks associated with the potential adverse impact of the
Cases on the Company’s liquidity and results of operations; changes in the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations
during the Cases and to maintain contracts that are critical to its operations; the outcome and timing of the Cases and any potential

Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer
of Listing
.
On
May 8, 2025, Soluna Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) received written notice (the “Notice”) from The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that the closing bid price for the Company’s common stock had been below $1.00 per share for
the previous 30 consecutive business days, and that the Company is therefore not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement
for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).
The
Notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
In
accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has a period of 180 calendar days, or until November 4, 2025, to regain
compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock must
meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period.
If
the Company is not in compliance by November 4, 2025, the Company may qualify for a second 180 calendar-day period to regain compliance.
If the Company does not qualify for, or fails to regain compliance during the second compliance period, then Nasdaq will notify the Company
of its determination to delist its common stock, at which point the Company would have an option to appeal the delisting determination
to a Nasdaq hearings panel.
The
Company intends to actively monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available
strategies to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules."

ACXP,0001104659-25-046167,2025-05-08,"1.01, 3.02, 9.01","Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 8, 2025, Acurx Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase
Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”), pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase
up to $12.0 million in shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share.
Concurrently with the execution
of the Purchase Agreement on May 8, 2025, we also entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”)
with Lincoln Park, relating to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), of the
offer and sale of the securities that have been and may be issued and sold by us to Lincoln Park, from time to time in our sole discretion,
from and after the date of this report, under the Purchase Agreement and to take such other specified actions to maintain such registration
under the Securities Act.
Under the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated
to purchase, up to $12.0 million in shares of our common stock. Such sales of our common stock, if any, will be subject to certain limitations,
and may occur from time to time, at our sole discretion, over the 24-month period commencing on the date that a registration statement
covering the resale by Lincoln Park of shares that have been and may be issued under the Purchase Agreement is declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and a final prospectus, if necessary, in connection therewith is filed and
the other conditions in the Purchase Agreement are satisfied (the date on which all such conditions are satisfied, the “Commencement
Date”).
After the Commencement Date,
on any business day, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 60,000 shares of our common stock (each, a “Regular Purchase”);
provided that the share amount under a Regular Purchase may be increased to up to 90,000 shares or up to 120,000 shares if the closing
sale price of our common stock is not below $2.00 or $3.00, respectively, on the business day on which we initiate the Regular Purchase.
However, Lincoln Park’s maximum commitment in any single Regular Purchase may not exceed $500,000. Each Regular Purchase is subject
to adjustment for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction
as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share for each Regular Purchase will be 97% of the lower of (i) the lowest
sale price of our common stock on the business day on which we initiate the Regular Purchase and (ii) the average of the three lowest
closing sale prices of our common stock during the 10-business day period immediately preceding the business day on which we initiate
the Regular Purchase. In addition to Regular Purchases, we may also direct Lincoln Park to purchase other amounts of common stock as accelerated
purchases and as additional accelerated purchases, subject to limits specified in the Purchase Agreement, at a purchase price per share
calculated as specified in the Purchase Agreement.
Sales of shares of our common
stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including,
among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determination as to the appropriate sources of funding
for our operations. We expect that any proceeds we receive from such sales will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
In addition, under applicable
Nasdaq rules, we may not issue or sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement more than 19.99% of the shares of our common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement (the “Exchange Cap”), unless (i) we obtain stockholder
approval to issue shares in excess of the Exchange Cap or (ii) the average price of all applicable sales of our common stock to Lincoln
Park under the Purchase Agreement equals or exceeds $0.3545 per share (which represents the lower of (A) the official closing price of our
common stock on Nasdaq immediately preceding the signing of the Purchase Agreement and (B) the average official closing price of our common
stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Purchase Agreement).
In any event, the Purchase Agreement specifically provides that we may not issue or sell any shares of our common stock under the Purchase
Agreement if such issuance or sale would breach any applicable Nasdaq rules.
Lincoln Park has no right
to require us to sell any shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, but Lincoln Park is obligated to make purchases as we direct, subject
to the conditions and limitations in the Purchase Agreement including beneficial ownership limitations.
In connection with entering
into the Purchase Agreement, on May 8, 2025, we issued 899,258 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park in consideration for its commitment
to purchase shares under the Purchase Agreement.
The Purchase Agreement and
the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, conditions, covenants, Suspension Events (as defined
in the Purchase Agreement) and indemnification obligations of the parties. We agreed not to effect any issuance of, or enter into any
agreement to effect any issuance of, shares of common stock or common stock equivalents involving a “variable rate transaction,”as such term is defined the Purchase Agreement, subject to limited exceptions, including our ability to issue and sell our common stock
pursuant to our previously announced “at-the-market offering,” through the 24-month anniversary of the Purchase Agreement.
Lincoln Park agreed not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect, short selling of or hedging with respect
to our common stock during the term of the Purchase Agreement. We may terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time after the Commencement
Date, at no cost or penalty.
This report shall not constitute
an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any shares of our common stock, nor shall there be any sale of shares of common
stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification
under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.
The foregoing summary of the
material terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, copies of which are attached as exhibits to this report, and each of which
is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The representations, warranties and covenants in such agreements were made only for
purposes of such agreements and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements, and may be subject
to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
The information contained above in Item 1.01 is
incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.
In the Purchase Agreement,
Lincoln Park represented to the Company, among other things, that it is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in
Rule 501(a)(3) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The shares of common stock
that were issued and may be issued to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement were not and will not be registered under the Securities
Act or qualified under any state securities laws. Such shares were issued and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act.

1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On
May 7, 2025 (the “Closing Date”), bioAffinity Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”),
consummated a best efforts public offering (the “Offering”) of an aggregate of (i) 7,784,904 shares (the “Shares”)
of common stock, par value $0.007 per share (the “Common Stock”), (ii) pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”)
to purchase up to 2,371,346 shares of Common Stock (“Pre-Funded Warrants Shares”) in lieu of Shares, and (iii) warrants
(“May 2025 Warrants”) to purchase up to 15,234,375 shares of Common Stock (the “May 2025 Warrant Shares”)
(which number of May 2025 Warrant Shares is equal to 150% of the aggregate number of Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants sold in the Offering).
Each Share and accompanying May 2025 Warrant was sold at a combined public offering price of $0.32. Each Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying
May 2025 Warrant was sold at a combined public offering price of $0.313.
The
aggregate gross proceeds from the Offering was approximately $3.2 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses.
The Company intends to use the proceeds of the Offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
The
Securities Purchase Agreement
In
connection with the Offering, on May 5, 2025, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”)
with certain investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed not to effect or enter into an agreement to effect any issuance by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries of shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for a period of sixty (60) days from the closing of
the Offering and will not enter into variable rate transactions for a period of 12 months following the closing of the Offering, subject
to certain exceptions, including that the prohibition against entering into an “at the market” offering will expire 60 days
following the closing of the Offering.
The
foregoing does not purport to be a complete description of the Purchase Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of such document, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The
Placement Agency Agreement
Also,
in connection with the Offering, on May 5, 2025, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement (the “Placement Agency Agreement”)
with WallachBeth Capital LLC (the “Placement Agent”), pursuant to which the Placement Agent agreed to act as placement agent
on a “best efforts” basis in connection with the Offering. The Company paid the Placement Agent an aggregate fee equal to
8.0% of the gross proceeds raised in the Offering and reimbursed the Placement Agent $120,000 for its expenses in connection with the
Offering. In addition, the Company issued to designees of the Placement Agent warrants (the “Placement Agent Warrants”) to
purchase 304,687 shares of Common Stock (the “Placement Agent Warrant Shares”), which number of shares is equal to 3.0% of
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants sold in the Offering.
The
Placement Agency Agreement and the Purchase Agreement each contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company,
customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the Company, the Placement Agent, or the purchasers in the Offering,
as the case may be, other obligations of the parties and termination provisions. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Placement
Agency Agreement, the Company’s executive officers and directors have entered into agreements providing that, for a period of sixty
(60) days from the closing of the Offering, each of these persons may not, subject to customary exceptions, offer, issue, sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of the Company’s securities without the prior written consent of the Placement Agent. The Placement Agency
Agreement also provides that the Company will not effect or enter into an agreement to effect any issuance by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries of shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for a period of sixty (60) days from the closing of the Offering and
will not enter into variable rate transactions for a period of 12 months following the closing of the Offering, subject to certain exceptions,
including that the prohibition against entering into an “at the market” offering will expire 60 days following the closing
of the Offering.
The
foregoing does not purport to be a complete description of the Placement Agency Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of such document, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The
Securities Offered
Each
Pre-Funded Warrant is immediately exercisable for one (1) share of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $0.007 per share and will remain exercisable until the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The exercise price of the
Pre-Funded Warrants and number of Pre-Funded Warrant Shares
will adjust in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar
events.
The
May 2025 Warrants will have an initial exercise price of $0.352 per share (110% of the combined public offering price per share of Common
Stock and accompanying May 2025 Warrant). The number of May 2025 Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the May 2025 Warrants
is subject to the following adjustments: (i) a 30% increase in the number of shares of Common Stock that would be issuable upon exercise
of the May 2025 Warrants if a reverse stock split is effected prior to the expiration of the May 2025 Warrants (the “Reverse Stock
Split Adjustment”), and (ii) subject to Warrant Stockholder Approval (as defined below), a decrease of the exercise price of the
May 2025 Warrants, if in a subsequent offering of the Company’s securities the price paid for Common Stock, the exercise price
of any options or warrants or the conversion price of any convertible securities issued in such subsequent offering is less than the
exercise price immediately prior to such subsequent offering, to an exercise price that is equal to the lowest of the price paid for
Common Stock, the exercise price of any options or warrants or the conversion price of any convertible securities issued in such subsequent
offering (subject to a floor of $0.10 per share) and an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the May 2025 Warrants
upon such exercise price reset so that the reset exercise price multiplied by the increased number of shares equals the aggregate proceeds
that would have resulted from the full exercise of the May 2025 Warrants immediately prior to the reset (the “Anti-Dilution Adjustment”).
The May 2025 Warrants will be immediately exercisable, except that the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the
May 2025 Warrants pursuant to the Anti-Dilution Adjustment will be subject to the filing of an amendment to the Company’s certificate
of incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to
increase the Company’s authorized number of shares of Common Stock to 350,000,000 shares (the “Certificate of Amendment”)
and the date of stockholder approval of the Anti-Dilution Adjustment (collectively, the “Warrant Stockholder Approval”).
The May 2025 Warrants will expire on the five-year anniversary of the later of the date that the Company files a Current Report on Form
8-K giving public notice of the Warrant Stockholder Approval (the “Stockholder Approval Notice Date”) and the effective date
of the filing of the Certificate of Amendment.
The
Company agreed not to consummate a subsequent offering of its securities at a price less than the exercise price of the May 2025 Warrants
immediately prior to such subsequent offering (a “Dilutive Issuance”) until the earlier of (i) eight months from the closing
date of the Offering; and (ii) later of: (a) the filing of a registration statement registering certain shares of Common Stock issuable
as a result of the Anti-Dilution Adjustment; (b) the Stockholder Approval Notice Date; and (c) the effective date of the filing of the
Certificate of Amendment. Based on an initial exercise price of $0.352 per share (equal to 110% of the combined offering price per Share
and accompanying May 2025 Warrant), if a reverse stock split is effected an additional 4,570,312 shares of Common Stock (on a pre-reverse
stock split basis which number shall be adjusted based on the reverse stock split ratio) will be issuable upon exercise of the May 2025
Warrants and then, subject to obtaining Warrant Stockholder Approval, if a Dilutive Issuance is consummated, an additional 49,907,811
shares of Common Stock (on a pre-reverse stock split basis which number shall be adjusted based on the reverse stock split ratio) would
be issuable upon exercise of the May 2025 Warrants.
The
exercise price of the May 2025 Warrants and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof will also adjust in the event
of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events.
The
Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis at any time. The May 2025 Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis if at
the time of exercise there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for,
the issuance of the May 2025 Warrant Shares to the holder, provided however that those purchasers who do not enter into the Purchase
Agreement and do not provide the Company with information required for registration of the resale of shares of Common Stock shall not
have any of their shares issuable as a result of an Anti-Dilution Adjustment included in the registration statement the Company will
file covering shares issuable as a result of an Anti-Dilution Adjustment and will not be able to effect a cashless exercise with respect
to such shares.
A
holder of the May 2025 Warrants and the Pre-Funded Warrants (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the May 2025
Warrant or Pre-Funded Warrant to the extent that the holder would own more than 4.99% (or 9.99%, at the election of the holder) of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after exercise, except that upon at least 61 days’ prior notice from the holder
to the Company, the holder may increase the amount of beneficial ownership of outstanding shares after exercising the holder’s
May 2025 Warrants or Pre-Funded Warrants up to 9.99% of the number of the Company’s shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after giving effect to the exercise.
The
Placement Agent Warrants have substantially the same terms as the May 2025 Warrants, including the Reverse Stock Split Adjustment; however,
they do not contain the Anti-Dilution Adjustment. The Placement Agent Warrants are immediately exercisable and will terminate five (5)
years from the commencement of sales of the securities in the Offering.
The
Shares, the Pre-Funded Warrants, the Pre-Funded Warrant Shares, the May 2025 Warrants, the May 2025 Warrant Shares, the Placement Agent
Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrant Shares were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement
on Form S-1 (File No. 333-286921), filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) that became effective on May 5, 2025.
The
foregoing does not purport to be a complete description of each of the Pre-Funded Warrants, the May 2025 Warrants or the Placement Agent
Warrants, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of such document, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2
and 4.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

As reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed
by RYVYL Inc. (the “Company”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 24, 2025, the Company entered into a
stock purchase agreement, dated January 23, 2025 (the “SPA”) with a purchaser (the “Purchaser”) which provides

Company’s indirect subsidiary domiciled in Bulgaria, Ryvyl (EU) EAD (“Ryvyl EU”), by Transact Europe Holdings EOOD,
the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, also domiciled in Bulgaria (“Transact Europe”) for an aggregate purchase price
of $15,000,000. On January 23, 2025, the Company, Transact Europe and the Purchaser also entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination
Agreement”). Among other things, the Termination Agreement provided the Company with the right to terminate the SPA and all of the
transactions contemplated therein, by paying the Purchaser $16.5 million prior to the 90
th
day after the date of execution
of the SPA (April 23, 2025), provided that such date may have been extended an additional 30 days (May 23, 2025) in consideration for
the Company’s payment of $500,000 to the Purchaser.
As reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed
by the Company on April 24, 2025, the Company, Transact Europe and the Purchaser executed and entered into a Modification Agreement dated
April 23, 2025 providing that, notwithstanding the terms of the Termination Agreement or the SPA, the Purchaser will not take any actions
to close on the purchase of the Ryvyl EU Shares before May 6, 2025, so that the Company and the Purchaser may attempt to enter into an
alternative transaction in lieu of the securities purchase transaction under the SPA. The Company had the right, at any time, on or before
May 6, 2025, to extend this period, so that the Purchaser would not exercise such right to purchase the Ryvyl EU Shares, until May 27,
2025, in consideration for the Company’s payment to the Purchaser of $750,000.
On May 7, 2025, the Purchaser provided a letter of
notice to the Company and Transact Europe, that due to the Company not exercising its right to terminate the SPA by payment to the Purchaser
of $16.5 million within the time so prescribed by the Termination Agreement, and as the Company has not exercised its right to extend
the period during which time the Purchaser agreed not to exercise its rights to close on the transaction per the Modification Agreement
(the “Standstill Period”), the Company no longer has the right to terminate the SPA pursuant to the Termination Agreement,
and the Standstill Period has expired. The Purchaser has notified the Company that notwithstanding the foregoing, they do not intend to
take the final steps to close on the purchase of the Ryvyl EU Shares for a period of ten calendar days from and including the date of
the letter, or until May 16, 2025. The parties continue to be in conversation during this period. All other terms of the SPA and the
Termination Agreement remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

The Shares were offered at an offering price of $0.15 per Share. The Common Warrants were offered concurrently with the Shares.
The Series F Common Warrants will have an exercise price of $0.30 per share, will be immediately exercisable and will expire on the five-year anniversary of the original issuance date, subject to the certain terms as defined in such Series F Common Warrant. The Series G Common Warrants will have an exercise price of $0.15 per share, will be immediately exercisable and will expire on the earlier of (i) the 24-month anniversary of the original issuance date or (ii) the expiration of the FDA Exercise Period (as such term is defined in the Series G Common Warrant).

The gross proceeds from the Offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and offering expenses, were expected to be $11.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds received from the Offering for general working capital purposes.
As described in more detail in Item 3.01 below, after the Purchase Agreement was executed, on May 7, 2025 the Company received notice from NYSE Regulation that it had suspended trading of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE American LLC stock exchange (“NYSE American”). Subsequently, also on May 7, 2025, the Company issued a press release discussing matters disclosed in Item 3.01 below. A copy of such press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Also on May 7, 2025, certain investors notified the Company that an event listed under Section 2.3(b)(v) of the Purchase Agreement had occurred and that such investors would not proceed to closing in connection with the Offering.
As a result, on May 8, 2025, the Company raised approximately $1.1 million in net proceeds from the reduced Offering. The Company intends to use the net proceeds received from the Offering for general working capital purposes.
The securities were offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-286280) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) and declared effective on May 6, 2025.
The Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties that the parties made to, and solely for the benefit of, each other in the context of all of the terms and conditions of that agreement and in the context of the specific relationship between the parties. The Purchase Agreement also contains customary conditions to closing, termination rights of the parties, certain indemnification obligations of the Company and ongoing covenants for the Company, including a prohibition on the Company’s sale and issuance of additional securities for a period of 45 days from the closing date of the Offering and entering into variable rate transactions (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for a period of 4 months from the closing date of the Offering, subject to certain exceptions.

However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% upon notice to us, provided that any increase in this limitation will not be effective until 61 days after such notice from the holder to us and such increase or decrease will apply only to the holder providing such notice.

Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On May 6, 2025, Zoomcar Holdings,
Inc. (the “Company”) received notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel
(the “Panel”) has determined to delist the Company’s common stock and public warrants. Suspension of trading in the
Company’s common stock will be effective at the open of trading on May 8, 2025. Following the delisting of its common stock from
the Nasdaq Global Market, the Company will continue to be a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company
expects its common stock and public warrants will commence trading on the OTC Markets Group platform at the open of trading on May 8,
2025, under the symbols “ZCAR” and “ZCARW,” respectively. The Company has applied for trading on the OTCQX Best
Market for its common stock and on the OTCQB Venture Market for its public warrants.
The Company has a period of 15
days from the date of the notice letter to submit a written request for a review of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel’s delisting determination
by the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council. The Company does not plan to appeal the Panel’s determination and expects that
a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which would remove the Company’s common
stock and public warrants from listing and registration on Nasdaq.
As previously reported, on
November 6, 2024, the “Company received a staff delist determination letter from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department
(the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) as a result of the Company’s failure to maintain
compliance with the market value of listed securities requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market under Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5450(b)(2)(A). On January 9, 2025, the Company presented a compliance plan to the Panel. On January 23, 2025, the Company received
a further notice from the Staff, notifying the Company that its failure to maintain compliance with the market value of publicly held
shares requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) (“MVPHS”)
serves as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq. Shortly thereafter, the Company submitted to the
Panel its plan of compliance with respect to the MVPHS deficiency.
On February 10, 2025, the
Company received a letter from the Panel (the “Panel Decision Letter”) stating that, based on the information presented, the
Panel has determined to grant the Company’s request for continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to the Company satisfying certain conditions,
including transferring its listing to The Nasdaq Capital Market and demonstrating compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which
requires a stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Equity Rule”),
on or before March 31, 2025.
Upon presentation of an update
to the Panel on March 28, 2025, the Panel granted the Company’s request to extend the period of time in which to satisfy the Equity
Rule for continued listing to May 5, 2025, and to remain listed on Nasdaq until that date, subject to certain conditions. These conditions
included that the Company provide a written update on the status of its plans to obtain financing and strengthen its balance sheet, as
well as provide prompt notification of any significant events that may occur during the period of extension that may affect the Company’s
compliance with Nasdaq requirements.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Agreement and Plan
of Merger
On May 7, 2025, Hall
of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company (the “Company”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) with HOFV Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), Omaha Merger Sub, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”, and together with Parent, the “Buyer
Parties”), and, solely as guarantor of certain of Parent’s obligations under the Merger Agreement, CH Capital Lending,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Guarantor” or “CHCL”).
The Merger Agreement
provides that, among other things and on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the
Merger (the “Effective Time”), (a) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”),
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”), (b) each
issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”),
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares (as defined below) or dissenting shares) will be converted
into the right to receive $0.90 in cash without interest and subject to applicable withholding (the “Merger Consideration”),
(c) each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer Parties,
and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by affiliates of the Buyer Parties immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively,“Owned Company Shares”) will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor, (d) each share of 7.00% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company and
each share of 7.00% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor, and (e) each
share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into
and become one fully paid, nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which will
thereafter represent the ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.
The Merger Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated thereby (the “Transaction”) were approved by the Company’s Board of Directors
(the “Company Board”) based upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee thereof consisting only of independent
and disinterested directors. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company Board resolved to recommend that the Company’s
stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger.
Treatment of Company Restricted Stock
Unit Awards
Each outstanding award
of restricted stock units covering shares of Company Common Stock that is governed under any Company Equity Plan (as defined by the Merger
Agreement) (“Company RSUs”) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest
and subject to applicable withholding, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSUs by (b) the Merger Consideration.
Treatment of Warrants
Each Series A Warrant
and Series B Warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Public Warrant”) that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will, in accordance with its terms and by virtue of the Merger, automatically and
without any action of the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, cease to represent a Public Warrant exercisable
for Company Common Stock and will become a Public Warrant exercisable for the Merger Consideration that such holder would have received
if such holder had exercised its Public Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Warrant Payment”); provided
that if a holder of a Series A Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time properly exercises
such Series A Warrant within 30 days following the public disclosure of the consummation of the Merger, the exercise price with respect
to such exercise will be treated in accordance with the terms of Section 4.4 of the Warrant Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2018, governing
the Series A Warrants; and provided, further, that, in connection with the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will, at the option of a
holder of a Series B Warrant, exercisable at any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the consummation of the Merger (or,
if later, the date of the public announcement of the Merger), purchase the Series B Warrant from such holder by paying to such holder
an amount of cash equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the Series B Warrant) of the remaining unexercised portion of the Series
B Warrant on the date of the consummation of the Merger. We note the Series A Warrants expire on July 1, 2025. Since the Merger Consideration
is all cash and the Merger Consideration payable upon exercise of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants is less than the applicable
exercise price of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, holders of such warrants would receive less cash than the exercise price
thereof upon exercise thereof. We anticipate the Black Scholes Value of the Series B Warrants to be approximately zero.
1
Each Private Warrant
and Series X Warrant (in each case, as defined by the Merger Agreement), other than warrants owned by any affiliate of the Buyer Parties
(which will be cancelled and extinguished without any consideration paid therefor) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holder thereof, cease to represent a Private Warrant or Series X Warrant, as applicable, exercisable for Company Common Stock and
shall become a warrant exercisable for the Merger Consideration that such holder would have received if such holder had exercised its
Private Warrants or Series X Warrants, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement provides holders of
such warrants exercisable for the Merger Consideration will have 30 days following public disclosure of the consummation of the Merger
to exercise such warrants and receive the Merger Consideration. Since the Merger Consideration is all cash and the Merger Consideration
payable upon exercise of the Private Warrants and the Series X Warrants is less than the applicable exercise price of the Private Warrants
and the Series X Warrants, holders of such warrants would receive less cash than the exercise price thereof upon exercise thereof.
Conditions to the Merger
The
completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary mutual closing conditions, including (a)
t
he adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power
of the outstanding Company Common Stock (the “Requisite Stockholder Approval”) and (b) the absence of any law, order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or other action that is in effect by a governmental authority making illegal, restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or preventing the consummation of the Merger. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger
is also conditioned on the other party’s representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain customary materiality
exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement. The obligation of
the Buyer Parties to consummate the Merger is additionally conditioned on (1) no material adverse effect on the Company having occurred
since the execution of the Merger Agreement, (2) the Buyer Partners shall have received a certificate of the Company, validly executed
by a duly authorized executive officer of the Company, certifying that certain conditions of the Merger Agreement have been satisfied,
(3) Parent (or any direct or indirect affiliate thereof) shall have received financing (“Parent Acquisition Financing”)
in an aggregate amount of not less than $20 million, (4) consummation of the Lease Restructuring (defined in Item
8.01 below), (5) consummation of additional project level financing in an aggregate amount not less than $125 million,
(6) Parent shall have received certain scheduled third-party consents, including certain consents on terms at the discretion of Parent,
(7) Parent shall have received resignation letters executed by each director and officer of the Company and its subsidiaries requested
by Parent, which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time, (8) Parent shall have received executed termination agreements
for certain scheduled related-party contracts and (9) no Insolvency Event (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall have occurred following
the execution of the Merger Agreement.
Termination
The Merger Agreement
contains termination rights for each of the Company and Parent, including, among others, (a) if the consummation of the Merger does not
occur on or before October 31, 2025 (subject to customary exceptions), (b) if any order prohibiting, making illegal or enjoining the Merger
has become final and non-appealable or any law shall have been enacted, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that permanently
prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation of the Merger, and (c) if the Requisite Stockholder Approval are not obtained at
the meeting of the Company’s stockholders for purposes of obtaining such Requisite Stockholder Approval. In addition, the Merger
Agreement may be terminated, (i) by Parent, if the Company has breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or other agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in a failure of certain conditions
to the obligation of Buyer Parties to effect the Merger, (ii) by Parent, if the Board, or a committee thereof, has effected a Company
Board Recommendation Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or the Company shall have materially breached any of its obligations
relating to not soliciting a an Acquisition Proposal (as defined by the Merger Agreement), (iii) by the Company, if any of the Buyer Parties
have breached or failed to perform any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the Merger
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in a failure of certain conditions to the obligation of the Company to effect
the Merger, (iv) by the Company, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if the Company is authorized to terminate
the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal and the Company pays a termination fee of
$1,000,000 (the “Company Termination Fee”) to Parent in accordance with the Merger Agreement, (v) by the Company, in
the event the cash available to the Company or the key employee resources of the Company are not reasonably sufficient to continue the
business and operations of the Company through the Closing Date, and the Company Board determines in good that the failure to Wind Down
the Company would likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties (vi) by Parent, if an Insolvency Event occurs, or (vii) by the Company,
at any time (x) after 120 days from the date of the Merger Agreement (the “Financing Period”), if the Binding Financing
Condition (defined in the Merger Agreement) has not been satisfied or (y) upon the occurrence of a Financing Failure Event (defined in
the Merger Agreement). The Company and Parent may also terminate the Merger Agreement by mutual written consent at any time prior to the
Closing.
2
The Company is required
to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee in cash on termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, among
others, termination by Parent in the event that the Board changes its recommendation in favor of the Merger or termination by the Company
to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal. The Merger Agreement also provides that, in certain circumstances,
either party may seek to compel the other party to specifically perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement
is terminated in certain circumstances, including after the expiration of the Financing Period, if the Binding Financing Condition has
not been satisfied, or upon the occurrence of a Financing Failure Event, in each case if Parent has breached or failed to perform its
obligation to use its reasonable efforts to obtain the Parent Acquisition Financing, which breach or failure to perform would result in
a failure of certain conditions to the obligation of the Company to effect the Merger, Parent would be required to pay the Company a termination
fee of $1,000,000.
Other Terms of
the Merger Agreement
The Merger Agreement
contains customary representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, in each case generally subject to customary materiality
qualifiers. Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides for customary pre-closing covenants of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, including
covenants relating to the Company conducting its and its subsidiaries’ business in the ordinary course, preserving its business
organizations substantially intact, preserving existing material business relationships substantially intact and refraining from taking
certain actions without Parent’s consent, subject to certain exceptions. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub also agreed to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated.
The Merger Agreement
provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company will be subject to certain
restrictions on its ability to solicit certain alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, provide non-public information to
third parties and engage in discussions or enter into agreements with third parties regarding certain alternative acquisition proposals,
subject to customary exceptions.
The foregoing description
of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement,
a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
The Merger Agreement
and the above description have been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. They are not intended to provide
any other factual information about the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective affiliates. The representations, warranties and
covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement as of the specific dates therein, were
solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including
being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement
instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that
differ from those applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions
thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries
or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the
Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures. Accordingly,

Parent and Merger Sub and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that will be contained in or attached as annex to the
proxy statement that the Company will file in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as in other
filings that the Company will make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Waterpark, Hotel and Stadium Lease Restructuring
Letter of Intent
On April 17, 2025, the Company and its subsidiary
HOF Village Newco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Newco”) entered into a letter of intent with HFAKOH001 LLC
(“Landlord”), CH Capital Lending, LLC, and Stuart Lichter (the “Lease Restructuring LOI”), which outlines (i)
certain non-binding terms regarding the waterpark property, the on-site hotel property, the stadium property, Newco’s 20% ownership
interest in Sandlot HOFV Canton SC, LLC and the 14 miscellaneous real estate parcels owned by the Company (the “Lease Restructuring”),
which terms are to be set forth in definitive lease restructuring documents (collectively, the “Lease Restructuring Transaction
Documents”), and (ii) binding terms regarding a breakage fee in the amount of the stadium property tax paid by Landlord on behalf
the Company of $1,988,185.72 (“Breakage Fee”) that would be owed by the Company and Newco to Landlord if the closing of the
Lease Restructuring Transaction Documents does not occur by September 30, 2025 (the “Outside Date”), subject to any agreed
extensions, as a result of a willful breach by an affiliate of our director Stuart Lichter to consummate the Merger.
Landlord currently owns the land upon which the
Company planned to construct a waterpark. The transactions contemplated by Lease Restructuring LOI include the following, which would
occur simultaneously: (i) Newco will transfer to Landlord fee title to the land on which Newco will construct a hotel on-site at Hall
of Fame Village (the “Hotel Property”); (2) the Company’s subsidiary HOF Village Stadium, LLC (“Stadium Owner”)
will transfer to Landlord its leasehold interest and the improvements constituting the Stadium Property; and (iii) Landlord, as landlord,
and Newco, as tenant will enter into a master triple net lease (the “New Lease”) with respect to the Waterpark Property, the
Hotel Property and the Stadium Property (collectively, the “New Leased Property”).
The Lease Restructuring LOI provides that the
initial lease term of the New Lease will be 99 years, and base rent will equal a 10% cap rate on Landlord’s total capital invested
in connection with the New Leased Property of approximately $55.5 million. Base rent will increase at a rate of 2.5% per  year. The New
Lease will further provide that Newco will complete construction of the waterpark (the “Waterpark”) on the Waterpark Property
and the hotel (the “Hotel”) on the Hotel Property. The New Lease will further provide for the following put-call rights: (i)
Newco Call Right
: At any time, Newco will have the right to purchase from Landlord either or both the Hotel Property and/or the
Waterpark Property for the price set forth on Schedule 1 to the Lease Restructuring LOI; (ii)
Landlord Put Right
: subject to six
months’ prior written notice of the exercise of such right, Landlord will have the right to require Newco to purchase from Landlord
both the Hotel Property and Waterpark Property any time following the earlier to occur of the fifth (5th) anniversary date of the completion
of the Waterpark and the sixth (6th) anniversary date of the closing of Lease Restructuring, for an amount equal to approximately $66.7
million; and (iii)
Stadium Property
: The Stadium Property will be conveyed to Newco for $1 upon the exercise of a Newco Call Right
or Landlord Put Right that results in Landlord having no further interest in the Waterpark Property and the Hotel Property.
Newco will deliver to Landlord a deed for the
14 Parcels and an assignment of the Youth Fields Interest, to be held by Landlord and to be deemed automatically delivered and released
to Landlord upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Lease. Upon the earlier to occur of (i) substantial completion of
the Waterpark and the payment by Newco to Landlord of an amount equal to approximately $4 million and (ii) closing of a Newco Call Right
or Landlord Put Right covering the Waterpark Property or the Hotel Property, Landlord will release its interest in the 14 Parcels and
the Youth Fields Interest.
These nonbinding terms and conditions of the Lease
Restructuring LOI are subject to modification or adjustment by the parties thereto any time up until any closing of the Lease Restructuring
Transaction Documents and are only a summary of certain terms and conditions to be more fully set forth in the Lease Restructuring Transaction
Documents.

a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 8, 2025 (the “Closing Date”),
Theriva Biologics, Inc. (the “Company”) consummated a public offering (the “Offering”) of an aggregate of
(i) 1,990,900 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”),
(ii) pre-funded warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 4,827,280 shares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded
Warrant Shares”), and (iii) Common Stock purchase warrants (“Common Warrants”) to purchase up to 6,818,180 shares
of Common Stock (the “Common Warrant Shares”). Each Share and associated Common Warrant to purchase one (1) Common Warrant
Share was sold at a combined public offering price of $1.10. Each Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Common Warrant to purchase one (1) Common
Warrant Share was sold at a combined public offering price of $1.099.
The Company received aggregate gross proceeds
from the Offering of approximately $7.5 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The Company intends
to use the proceeds of the Offering primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes, including for research and development
and manufacturing scale-up and may use a portion of the proceeds to invest in or acquire other products, businesses or technologies.
The Securities Offered
Each Pre-Funded Warrant is immediately exercisable
for one (1) Pre-Funded Warrant Shares at an exercise price of $0.001 per share and will remain exercisable until such Pre-Funded
Warrant is exercised in full. Each Common Warrant has an exercise price of $1.10 per Common Warrant Share, is immediately exercisable,
and expires five (5) years from its issuance date.
The Shares, Pre-Funded Warrants and accompanying
Common Warrants were issued separately.
The
exercise price of the Common Warrants and the Pre-Funded Warrants and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise will be
adjusted in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events.
In the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in each of the Common Warrants and the Pre-Funded Warrants, the holders
of the such warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of their respective warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or
other property that the holders would have received had they exercised their warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction.
In addition, in certain circumstances, upon a fundamental transaction, a holder of Common Warrants will have the right to require us to
repurchase its Common Warrants at the Black Scholes Value; provided, however, that, if the fundamental transaction is not within the Company’s
control, including not approved by the Company’s board of directors, then the holder shall only be entitled to receive the same
type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised portion of the Common Warrant,
that is being offered and paid to the holders of common stock in connection with the fundamental transaction.
The Common Warrants may be exercised on a cashless
basis if at the time of exercise thereof there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein
is not available for, the issuance of the Common Warrant Shares to the holder. The Pre-Funded Warrants may be exercised on a cashless
basis at any time.
A holder of the Common Warrants and the Pre-Funded
Warrants (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the Common Warrant or Pre-Funded Warrant to the extent that the
holder would own more than 4.99% (or 9.99%, at the election of the holder) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after
exercise, except that upon at least 61 days’ prior notice from the holder to the Company, the holder may increase the amount of
beneficial ownership of outstanding shares after exercising the holder’s Common Warrants or Pre-Funded Warrants up to 9.99% of the
number of the Company’s shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise.
The Shares, the Common Warrants, the Common Warrant
Shares, the Pre-Funded Warrants and the Pre-Funded Warrant Shares were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to the Company’s
Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-283722), filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) that became effective on May 7,
2025.
The foregoing does not purport to be a complete
description of each of the Common Warrants or the Pre-Funded Warrants, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of each of such document, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this “Form 8-K”)

2025, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain investors, pursuant
to which the Company agreed not to effect or enter into an agreement to effect any issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
of shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for a period of ninety (90) days and will not directly or indirectly offer
to sell, sell, grant any option to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of its Common Stock or any securities convertible into, exercisable
or exchangeable for its shares of Common Stock in any “at-the-market,” continuous equity, equity lines, or variable rate transaction,
for a period of six (6) months after the Closing Date of the Offering, provided that the foregoing shall not apply, (x) following
the seventy-five (75) day anniversary of the Closing Date, to sales under the “at-the-market” offering in which the Placement
Agent (as defined below) is the sales agent, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Sales Agreement dated February 9, 2021, as amended,
by and between the Company and the Placement Agent or (y) following the forty-five (45) day anniversary of the Closing Date, to the

Agreement
Also, in connection with the Offering, on May 7,

Partners (the “Placement Agent”), pursuant to which the Placement Agent agreed to act as placement agent on a “reasonable
best efforts” basis in connection with the Offering. The Company paid the Placement Agent an aggregate fee equal to 7.0% of the
gross proceeds raised in the Offering. Further, the Company agreed to reimburse the Placement Agent up to an aggregate of $100,000 for

to customary exceptions, offer, issue, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Company’s securities without the prior written
consent of the Placement Agent. The Placement Agency Agreement also provides that for a period of six (6) months after the Offering
the Company will not directly or indirectly offer to sell, sell, grant any option to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of its Common
Stock or any securities convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for its shares of Common Stock in any “at-the-market,”continuous equity, equity lines, or variable rate transaction, without the prior written consent of the Placement Agent, provided that
the foregoing shall not apply, (x) seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, to the “at-the-market” offering with
the Placement Agent as sales agent Agent or (y) following the forty-five (45) day anniversary of the Closing Date, to the filing
of a prospectus supplement with respect to such sales.

The Amendment amends Section 4 to the Note to allow the Company to elect, in its sole discretion, to pay the interest accrued during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2026 in the form of its common stock at a per share value of $1.00 per share. All other terms of the Note remain the same. Skywords is controlled by Michael Davis, the Company’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and largest stockholder.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Effective as of June 16, 2025, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company has renewed the Executive Employment Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2025 (the “Employment Agreement”) with Matthew K. Custer as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Employment Agreement supersedes any prior employment agreements with the Company.
The term of the Employment Agreement will begin on June 16, 2025 and end on June 16, 2029, followed by successive one-year periods thereafter unless terminated by either party upon 45 days advance written notice. The Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Custer will receive an annual base salary of $225,000 (to be increased to $250,000 when the Company has two consecutive audited break-even quarters), with $200,000 payable in cash and the remaining $25,000 to be delivered in the form of restricted stock units that will vest in equal installments over three years, provided that, in the event of his termination of employment for any reason other than for cause, the award will vest in full upon his termination. Mr. Custer is also eligible to receive a $25,000 signing bonus at the Company’s discretion when it is in a stronger cash position. Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Custer will receive a one-time grant of stock options to acquire 150,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Options”) under the Company’s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan on June 16, 2025, subject to the terms of the Plan and a Stock Option Grant Notice and Option Agreement.

Mr. Custer will continue to be eligible to participate in all other employee benefit plans and compensation programs that the Company maintains for salaried employees and executive officers.
If Mr. Custer’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or Mr. Custer resigns for good reason, subject to Mr. Custer’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims against the Company, he will be entitled to receive severance equal to his base salary for 12 months or for the remainder of the term of the Employment Agreement, whichever is less, paid in installments, any accrued but unpaid amount due under the Employment Agreement and continuation of benefits for the applicable severance benefit period.

Acquisition of Assets
As previously disclosed, in February 2025, Catheter Precision, Inc. (the “Company”) formed its subsidiary Cardionomix, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“Cardionomix”), in order to pursue the acquisition of certain assets of Cardionomic, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which has ceased operations. We issued 82% of the common stock of Cardionomix to the Company, 5% to David Jenkins, our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board, 7% to FatBoy Capital L.P., an entity controlled by Mr. Jenkins, and 6% to certain business associates of Mr. Jenkins. These minority interests were issued to compensate these persons for bringing this business opportunity to the Company.
On April 18, 2025, the Company and Cardionomix entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) with Cardionomic (assignment for the benefit of creditors), LLC, a California limited liability company (the “Seller”), in its sole and limited capacity as assignee for the benefit of creditors of Cardionomic, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Assignor”), pursuant to which Cardionomix purchased assets related to the Assignor's late-stage treatment in development for acute decompensated heart failure (the “Purchased Assets”), consisting of patents and trademarks related to the Assignor's Cardiac Pulmonary Nerve Simulation (CNPS) System.  In the Agreement, the Seller represents that Assignor had previously transferred ownership of all of its right, title and interest in and to all of its tangible and intangible assets, including the Purchased Assets, to Seller, and, in so doing, also designated Seller to act, pursuant to California law, as the assignee for the benefit of creditors of Assignor. The asset purchase closed on May 5, 2025.
Cardionomix acquired the Purchased Assets on an “AS IS” and “WHERE IS” basis, with no representations or warranties as to merchantability, fitness or use from Seller and no representations from or privity with Assignor, in exchange for the issuance by the Company of 1,000,000 restricted shares of the Company's common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Share Consideration”) and the issuance by Cardionomix of a promissory note (the ""Note"") in the amount of $1.5 million, with simple interest accruing at 4% per annum on the principal thereof and no interest or principal payable until the maturity date of the Note, which will be May 5, 2028.  Other material terms of the Note are set forth under Item 2.03 below. The Purchased Assets were delivered pursuant to the Agreement free and clear of certain specified known encumbrances.
Cardionomix has no significant assets other than the Purchased Assets. Accordingly, it will need to raise funds in order to develop the Purchased Assets. We have begun discussions with potential investors, but there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise sufficient funds for this purpose on a timely basis or at all.  Any such financing is likely to entail the issuance of additional securities by Cardionomix to such investors, which securities are also likely to provide certain corporate governance rights.  Such an issuance is expected to reduce the Company's ownership interest in Cardionomix, although it is expected to remain a majority owned consolidated entity.  The information set forth in this Current Report on Form 8-K is not an offer to sell or exchange, or solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities.
The foregoing summary of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 1.01 in its entirety by reference.
Caution Regarding Forward Looking Statements
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as ""believe,"" ""anticipate,"" ""may,"" ""might,"" ""can,"" ""could,"" ""continue,"" ""depends,"" ""expect,"" ""expand,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""predict,"" ""plan,"" ""rely,"" ""should,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""seek,"" “promising,” “potential,” ""seeking"" or the negative of these terms and other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Such forward-looking statements include our descriptions of our plans to procure financing for our general operations and to develop our assets.  These forward-looking statements are subject to the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, express and implied statements regarding our expectation to conclude financing for Cardionomix. The Company's expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a result of uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances, including but not limited to risks and uncertainties included under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's 2024 Form 10-K filed with the SEC and available at www.sec.gov. These risks and uncertainties include, but aren't limited to: that our ability to develop and commercialize the assets could be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain protection of the patents and trade names related thereto, which we are acquiring on an as is basis without recourse; that we may not be able to obtain the financing for Cardionomix that we anticipate and/or such financing even if obtained may not be adequate for the development of the assets; and that we may not adequately address the lessons learned from the pilot studies related to the assets, which included fatigue to nerves if stimulation is delivered for too long; high amplitude stimulation can lead to unstable hemodynamics, rhythm disturbances, and patient sensation; optimal stimulation response is dependent on more than just contractility; stimulation beyond 48 hours did not show additional benefit; stimulator modifications required to reduce procedure time, complexity, and improve user experience; and minor catheter modifications needed to accommodate larger anatomy in heart failure patients. FDA review of the assets is likely to be costly and lengthy, and there is no guarantee that clearance and approval will ever occur or occur on a timetable that is beneficial to the Company. Additionally, Cardionomix has other, minority investors aside from the Company, and future financings are expected to involve the issuance of securities by Cardionomix, which will reduce the Company’s share in the profits, if any, from the Purchased Assets and Cardionomix, and is likely to involve the grant of special corporate governance rights to other subsidiary investors so that the Company will not have unfettered control of Cardionomix. There is no guarantee that the success of the Cardionomic pilot studies will be repeated in future trials or ultimately lead to a successful commercialization of the Purchased Assets. The medical device industry in general is highly competitive, and some of our competitors have longer, more established operating histories, with significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other resources. The Purchased Assets are not the only device-based neuromodulation therapy currently in development for the treatment of heart failure and further must also compete against potential new drug therapies. In general, results of anticipated trials may not turn out as we currently expect, and future trials may not occur on the time tables we expect or may be more costly than anticipated. In addition, our forward looking statements are subject to the following additional uncertainties and risks: we do not have sufficient liquidity to fund our business unless we are able to obtain additional financing or enter into a strategic transaction that would provide additional liquidity during the next three months, we will not be able to reach profitability unless we are able to achieve our product expansion and growth goals, our research and development and commercialization efforts may depend on entering into agreements with corporate collaborators, we have in the past entered into joint marketing agreements with respect to our products, and may again enter into additional joint marketing agreements in the future that could reduce our revenues from product sales, if we experience significant disruptions in our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected, litigation and other legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, if we make acquisitions or divestitures, we could encounter difficulties that harm our business, failure to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel could also impede our growth, failure to maintain effective internal controls could cause our investors to lose confidence in us and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, we have determined that our internal controls and disclosure controls were not effective as of March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2024, and as a result, without effective remediation of the material weaknesses that we have identified, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, our revenues may depend on our customers' receipt of adequate reimbursement from private insurers and government sponsored healthcare programs, we may be unable to compete successfully with companies in our highly competitive industry, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do, our future operating results depend upon our ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms or according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, and suppliers may fail to deliver components, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively or obtain these components on such terms, if hospitals, physicians and patients do not accept our current and future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any, our medical device operations are subject to pervasive and continuing FDA regulatory requirements, our products may be subject to additional recalls, revocations or suspensions after receiving FDA or foreign approval or clearance, which could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business, changes in trade policies among the U.S. and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher tariffs by the U.S. and/or its trading partners could increase our expenses, require us to increase prices, potentially lowering demand for our products, and/or reduce our revenues and operating results, and such increase , or the imposition of other barriers to international trade, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. Our efforts more generally to seek financing to fund general operations and develop our other assets are subject to the vagaries of the markets and the economy in general and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are favorable to the Company or at all.  The risks and uncertainties described above may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused significant economic uncertainty, or other pandemics, supply chain disruptions from the Ukraine war or Israeli-Hamas conflict and otherwise, and ongoing volatility in the stock markets and the U.S. economy in general.
The forward-looking statements included in this Form 8-K are made only as of the date hereof. The Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The information disclosed in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference, including the exhibit referenced therein and incorporated by reference therein.  The offering of securities pursuant to the Agreement was conducted in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and SEC Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.  The registrant has concluded that the exemption is available for this transaction in that there were  fewer than 35 unaccredited purchasers, no general solicitation or advertising occurred in connection with the offering, appropriate transfer restrictions have been imposed on the shares and reflected in a customary legend regarding same, disclosure was made as required by Rule 502(b).
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
As noted above, we have begun discussions with potential investors in order to obtain financing to develop the Purchased Assets.  Our description under Item 1.01 above related to such potential financing is incorporated into this Item 7.01 in full.  We are also actively seeking additional financing for the Company in order to fund our ongoing operations, develop our other assets and pursue general research and development, including financing through both public and private offerings, including a proposed at the market offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as private placements of our securities, including our common stock and other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, such as convertible preferred stock and warrants.  There can be no guarantees that any such financings will come to fruition, and issuances of equity in connection therewith may be dilutive to current stakeholders.  Our plans and proposals to seek such financings are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above under the heading “Caution Regarding Forward Looking Statements” contained in Item 1.01.

4.01 Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant
On
November 1, 2024, CBIZ CPA’s P.C. acquired the attest business of Marcum LLP (“Marcum”). On May 5, 2025, Marcum informed
Diamondhead Casino Corporation (the “Company”) that Marcum resigned as the Company’s independent registered public
accounting firm. On May 5, 2025, the Company, with the approval of the Board of Directors, engaged CBIZ CPAs P.C. as the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm.
Neither
of Marcum’s reports on the financial statements of the Registrant for either of the past two fiscal years ended December 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023 contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, or was qualified or modified as to audit scope, or accounting
principles.
During
the Registrant’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the subsequent interim period
through May 5, 2025, there were no disagreements with Marcum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of Marcum, would have caused it
to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report.
During
the Registrant’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the subsequent interim period
through May 5, 2025, the Company had the following “reportable events” (as such term is defined in Item 304 of Regulation
S-K): As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of the Company’s Form 10-K’s for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023, there were material weaknesses identified in internal control related to the segregation of duties within accounting functions
inasmuch as the Company had only one employee and the Company had not been timely in its financial reporting functions inasmuch as it
had not developed and effectively communicated its accounting policies and procedures, resulting in inconsistent practices with respect
to complex accounting transactions. The Company has designed and instituted policies and procedures to eliminate and/or mitigate the
foregoing.
The
Registrant has provided Marcum with a copy of the above disclosures prior to this filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “Commission”). A letter to the Commission, dated May 8, 2025, from Marcum, regarding its concurrence with the statements
made by the Registrant in this current report concerning the dismissal of Marcum as the Registrant’s independent registered public
accounting firm, is attached as Exhibit 16 hereto.
During
the Registrant’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the subsequent interim period through
May 5, 2025, neither the Registrant nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with CBIZ CPAs P.C. with respect to either (i) the application
of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered
on the Registrant’s consolidated financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Registrant
that CBIZ CPAs P.C. concluded was an important factor considered by the Registrant in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing
or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304 of Regulation
S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K).

The information discussed under Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02.
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
A summary of a presentation providing certain information regarding Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“BREIT” or the “Company”), is set forth below in this Current Report on Form 8-K under this Item 7.01. In addition, the Company has posted the full presentation on its website at
www.breit.com
under “For Stockholders” in the “Resources” section. References herein to “we,” “us” or “our” refer to the Company and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.
BREIT Q1 2025 Update
BREIT is off to a strong start in 2025 amidst tremendous volatility and declines in the public markets. Healthy cash flow growth powered a +1.9% net return in Q1 (Class I), our best quarter since Q3’23.
1,3*
Private real estate outperformance through periods of volatility isn’t new. In fact, in the eight years of negative returns for the S&P 500 since 1980, seven were positive for private real estate. Two of those years were since BREIT’s inception (2018 and 2022), and in both of those years, BREIT returned +8%.
4
We believe this is why you want to be invested in BREIT across market cycles: BREIT is a diversifying source of return in portfolios.
Since inception over eight years ago, BREIT has generated a +9.4% annualized net return (Class I), ~65% higher than publicly traded REITs and ~3x private real estate, as well as consistent historical monthly distributions with potential tax benefits.
1,2
In 2024, 96% of BREIT’s distribution was classified as return of capital, bringing our 4.8% pre-tax Class I distribution rate to 7.5% on a tax-equivalent basis.
5,6**
BREIT in Today’s Investment Environment
Against a backdrop of global macro uncertainty driven by recent tariff announcements, we believe investors want to own hard assets in the right sectors and markets at a discount to physical replacement cost.
7
Unlike the public markets, BREIT’s performance is primarily driven by underlying real estate fundamentals and cash flow growth, not public market forces like sentiment or geopolitical uncertainty.
While the recovery has not been V-shaped, we believe the pillars of the real estate recovery remain intact despite the challenges in the broader investment environment today. Unlike other asset classes, we believe real estate values have already reset over the past few years and the recovery is just getting started, with values up only 5% from the 2023 trough.
8
We believe private real estate offers compelling relative value today, particularly when compared to the S&P 500 and corporate bonds, which earlier this year peaked at 78% and 31%, respectively, above their 2022 lows.
9
Importantly, we continue to see healthy supply-demand fundamentals drive resilient cash flow growth.
3*
BREIT’s portfolio is concentrated in sectors with powerful secular demand tailwinds that we expect will generate growth in excess of GDP.
10
We have strategically invested in areas where structural shifts – like U.S. reindustrialization, Sunbelt migration and the rise of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and cloud computing – are transforming where people live, how they shop and how they use technology and real estate. The supply backdrop in our key sectors is equally favorable, with multifamily and industrial supply down two-thirds from 2022 levels to ten-year lows.
11,12
The cost to build an industrial asset has doubled over the last several years, and we believe that tariffs will drive these replacement costs even higher and further constrain new supply.
7
All of this is very supportive of BREIT’s existing real estate asset values.
Despite this more uncertain macro environment, capital markets remain open which is a critical driver of the broader real estate recovery. Although we have seen some widening in spreads and base rate volatility since the tariff announcements, the cost of capital remains 15% lower than a year ago and 40% lower than the 2023 peak.
13
We also continue to see strong lending appetite from banks who are generally underallocated to real estate.
14
Finally, although tariff announcements have created noise around inflation, inflation has already come down significantly in recent years, with the March inflation print at the lowest level since 2021.
15
While goods inflation could accelerate, we believe this will likely be transitory and further declines in other components of the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) like energy, services and shelter costs should mitigate the overall inflationary impact of tariffs. However, in the event we see higher inflation, real estate has historically served as an effective hedge.
16
Portfolio in a Position of Strength
BREIT’s portfolio of Blackstone Real Estate’s best ideas is ~90% concentrated in rental housing, industrial and data centers and ~70% concentrated in fast-growing Sunbelt markets.
17
Our conviction in these sectors and markets is underpinned by secular megatrends that we believe will continue to generate growth in excess of GDP.
10
In a risk-off world, we believe rental housing is the kind of asset class you want to own. Demand for rental housing has been durable across market cycles because people always need a place to live, with U.S. multifamily occupancy averaging ~95% over the long term.
18
We have also seen strong in-migration trends in BREIT’s Sunbelt markets drive healthy apartment demand. While we did see excess construction in the Sunbelt moderate multifamily rent growth in recent years, ~80% of BREIT’s multifamily markets are now at or past peak supply and new deliveries will continue to decline sharply over the next year.
19
This will only exacerbate the existing 4-5M home shortfall in the U.S., which combined with the fact that it is ~50% more expensive to own vs. rent, all sets up a very favorable outlook.
20,21
BREIT’s industrial portfolio continues to be powered by long-term tailwinds including the need for faster e-commerce deliveries and the reindustrialization of U.S. manufacturing, both of which generate significant local demand for infill warehouses. Since 2021, chip manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and electric vehicle companies have announced $700B in U.S. manufacturing investments, driving an estimated 3-5x increase in spillover warehouse demand from their supply chain.
22,23
BREIT is well-positioned to capture this because our portfolio is concentrated in top-performing markets in hotspots for reindustrialization such as Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas. BREIT also has limited exposure to coastal markets that may be more impacted by tariff-related disruptions. This resilient demand backdrop and collapsing new supply should generate continued cash flow growth, particularly as market rents are on average 22% above BREIT’s in-place rents.
24
Data centers continue to benefit from a once-in-a-generation explosion in demand from the rise of AI and migration to the cloud. The largest hyperscalers have increased their data center capital expenditures by 3x since 2022 and continue to reaffirm their commitment to investing in digital infrastructure as they grow their cloud businesses and increase their AI deployments.
25
Since Blackstone acquired our data center platform, QTS, in 2021, QTS’ leased capacity has grown by 9x and today is the largest data center company in the world.
26
QTS is also the most active developer in the U.S. with a $25B+ development pipeline that is 100% pre-leased to investment-grade tenants with 15+ year leases.
27***
In addition, QTS owns land with access to critical power that could support another $80B+ of construction.
27***
Amidst the recent tariff announcements, QTS remains well-positioned as 90% of its total costs, including materials, equipment and labor, are domestically sourced with no direct exposure to tariffs. In addition to proactive supply chain management, QTS’ credibility with customers, significant land bank, access to power and scale capital position QTS particularly well to deliver in today’s dynamic environment.
These healthy fundamentals across our key sectors are driving BREIT’s estimated 4% cash flow growth in the first quarter.
3
In addition, another driver of cash flow growth and ultimately long-term performance for BREIT is our embedded growth potential. Market rents in our portfolio are on average 12% above BREIT's in-place rents today, which we expect to capture as leases expire over the next few years even without further market rent growth.
28
We believe now is the time to be invested in BREIT and we are excited to build on our momentum so far in 2025. As we look ahead, we believe BREIT is exceptionally well-positioned to deliver diversification, stability and strong long-term performance. We remain grateful for your partnership and trust.

The properties, sectors and geographies referenced herein do not represent all BREIT investments. The selected investment examples presented or referred to herein may not be representative of all transactions of a given type or of investments generally and are intended to be illustrative of the types of investments that have been made or may be made by BREIT in employing its investment strategies.

Please refer to https://www.breit.com/properties for a complete list of real estate investments (excluding equity in public and private real estate related companies).
Blackstone Proprietary Data.
Certain information and data provided herein is based on Blackstone proprietary knowledge and data. Portfolio companies may provide proprietary market data to Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”), including about local market supply and demand conditions, current market rents and operating expenses, capital expenditures and valuations for multiple assets. Such proprietary market data is used by Blackstone to evaluate market trends as well as to underwrite potential and existing investments. While Blackstone currently believes that such information is reliable for purposes used herein, it is subject to change, and reflects Blackstone’s opinion as to whether the amount, nature and quality of the data is sufficient for the applicable conclusion, and no representations are made as to the accuracy or completeness thereof.
Embedded Growth.
Embedded growth represents Blackstone's expectations for growth based on its view of the current market environment taking into account rents that are currently below market rates and therefore have the potential to increase. These expectations are based on certain assumptions that may not be correct and on certain variables that may change, are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not constitute forecasts. There can be no assurance that any such results will actually be achieved.
Preliminary Estimated Same Property NOI Growth.
Represents BREIT’s year-to-date preliminary estimated same property NOI growth for the three months ended March 31, 2025 (compared to the prior year based on the midpoint of the preliminary estimated range of same property NOI). This data is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and our actual results may differ materially from this preliminary estimated data. Net Operating Income (“NOI”) is a supplemental non-GAAP measure of our property operating results that we believe is meaningful because it enables management to evaluate the impact of occupancy, rents, leasing activity and other controllable property operating results at our real estate. We define NOI as operating revenues less operating expenses, which exclude (i) impairment of investments in real estate, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) straight-line rental income and expense, (iv) amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles, (v) amortization of accumulated unrealized gains on derivatives previously recognized in other comprehensive income, (vi) lease termination fees, (vii) property expenses not core to the operations of such properties, (viii) other non-property-related revenue and expense items such as (a) general and administrative expenses, (b) management fee paid to the Adviser, (c) performance participation allocation paid to the Special Limited Partner, (d) incentive compensation awards, (e) income (loss) from investments in real estate debt, (f) change in net assets of consolidated securitization vehicles, (g) income (loss) from interest rate derivatives, (h) net gain on dispositions of real estate, (i) interest expense, net, (j) loss on extinguishment of debt, (k) other income (expense), and (ix) similar adjustments for NOI attributable to non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. We evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-property basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same property if they were owned for the full periods presented, otherwise they are considered non-same property. Recently developed properties are not included in same property results until the properties have achieved stabilization for both full periods presented. We define stabilization for the property as the earlier of (i) achieving 90% occupancy, (ii) 12 months after receiving a certificate of occupancy, or (iii) for Data Centers 12 months after receiving a certificate of occupancy and greater than 50% of its critical IT capacity has been built. Certain assets are excluded from same property results and are considered non-same property, including (i) properties held-for-sale, (ii) properties that are being redeveloped, (iii) properties identified for future sale, and (iv) interests in unconsolidated entities under contract for sale with hard deposit or other factors ensuring the buyer’s performance. We do not consider our investments in the real estate debt segment or equity securities to be same property. For more information, please refer to BREIT’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2025 and the prospectus. Additionally, please refer above for a reconciliation of preliminary estimated GAAP loss to preliminary estimated same property NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Tax Information.
The tax information herein is provided for informational purposes only, is subject to material change, and should not be relied upon as a guarantee or prediction of tax effects. This material also does not constitute tax advice to, and should not be relied upon by, potential investors, who should consult their own tax advisors regarding the matters discussed herein and the tax consequences of an investment. A portion of REIT ordinary income distributions may be tax deferred given the ability to characterize ordinary income as Return of Capital (“ROC”). ROC distributions reduce the stockholder’s tax basis in the
year the distribution is received, and generally defer taxes on that portion until the stockholder’s stock is sold via redemption. Upon redemption, the investor may be subject to higher capital gains taxes as a result of a lower cost basis due to the ROC distributions. Certain non-cash deductions, such as depreciation and amortization, lower the taxable income for REIT distributions. Investors should be aware that a REIT’s ROC percentage may vary significantly in a given year and, as a result, the impact of the tax law and any related advantage may vary significantly from year to year. At this time, the 20% rate deduction to individual tax rates on the ordinary income portion of distributions is set to expire on December 31, 2025. The tax benefits are not applicable to capital gain dividends or certain qualified dividend income and are only available for qualified REITs. If BREIT did not qualify as a REIT, the tax benefit would be unavailable. BREIT’s board also has the authority to revoke its REIT election. There may be adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes and other investments may offer tax advantages without the set expiration. An accelerated depreciation schedule does not guarantee a profitable return on investment and ROC reduces the basis of the investment. While we currently believe that the estimations and assumptions referenced herein are reasonable under the circumstances, there is no guarantee that the conditions upon which such assumptions are based will materialize or are otherwise applicable. This information does not constitute a forecast, and all assumptions herein are subject to uncertainties, changes and other risks, any of which may cause the relevant actual, financial and other results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the information presented herein. No assurance, representation or warranty is made by any person that any of the estimations herein will be achieved, and no recipient of this example should rely on such estimations. Investors may also be subject to net investment income taxes of 3.8% and/or state income tax in their state of residence which would lower the after-tax distribution rate received by the investor.
Third Party Information.
Certain information contained in this material has been obtained from sources outside Blackstone, which in certain cases have not been updated through the date hereof. While such information is believed to be reliable for purposes used herein, no representations are made as to the accuracy or completeness thereof and none of Blackstone, its funds, nor any of their affiliates takes any responsibility for, and has not independently verified, any such information. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to these estimates.
Trends.
There can be no assurances that any of the trends described herein will continue or will not reverse. Past events and trends do not imply, predict or guarantee, and are not necessarily indicative of, future events or results.
Use of Leverage.
BREIT uses and expects to continue to use leverage. If returns on such investment exceed the costs of borrowing, investor returns will be enhanced. However, if returns do not exceed the costs of borrowing, BREIT performance will be depressed. This includes the potential for BREIT to suffer greater losses than it otherwise would have. The effect of leverage is that any losses will be magnified. The use of leverage involves a high degree of financial risk and will increase BREIT's exposure to adverse economic factors such as rising interest rates, downturns in the economy or deteriorations in the condition of BREIT's investments. This leverage may also subject BREIT and its investments to restrictive financial and operating covenants, which may limit flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. For example, leveraged entities may be subject to restrictions on making interest payments and other distributions.
*Cash flow growth refers to same property net operating income (“NOI”) growth. Reflects BREIT’s year-over-year preliminary estimated same property NOI growth for the three months ended March 31, 2025. See “Important Disclosure Information–Preliminary Estimated Same Property NOI Growth”.
**Assumes that the investment in BREIT shares is not sold or redeemed. The tax-equivalent distribution rate would be up to 1.4% lower taking into account deferred capital gains tax that would be payable upon redemption. See notes 5 and 6 for more information.
***Reflects QTS’ development pipeline at 100% ownership interest. As of March 31, 2025, BREIT’s ownership interest in QTS was 35% and the QTS investment accounted for 14.6% of BREIT’s real estate asset value.
1
Represents BREIT Class I shares. Returns shown reflect the percent change in the NAV per share from the beginning of the applicable period, plus the amount of any distribution per share declared in the period.
All returns shown assume reinvestment of distributions pursuant to BREIT’s distribution reinvestment plan, are derived from unaudited financial information, and are net of all BREIT expenses, including general and administrative expenses, transaction related expenses, management fees, performance participation allocation, and share class-specific fees, but exclude the impact of early repurchase deductions on the repurchase of shares that have been outstanding for less than one year.
The inception dates for the Class I, D, S and T shares are January 1, 2017, May 1, 2017, January 1, 2017 and June 1, 2017, respectively. The returns have been prepared using unaudited data and valuations of the underlying investments in BREIT’s portfolio, which are estimates of fair value and form the basis for BREIT’s NAV. Valuations based upon unaudited reports from the underlying investments may be subject to later adjustments, may not correspond to realized value and may not accurately reflect the price at which assets could be liquidated. As return information is calculated based on NAV, return information presented will be impacted should the assumptions on which NAV was determined prove to be different.
Past performance does not predict future returns.
The Q1’25 figures for BREIT, S&P 500, Publicly Traded REIT’s and Corporate Bonds was 1.9%,  -4.3%, 1.1% and
1.0%, respectively. 3-Year returns are annualized consistent with the IPA Practice Guideline 2018. Please see www.breit.com/performance for information on BREIT returns.
2
Publicly traded REITs reflect the MSCI US REIT Index total return as of March 31, 2025. BREIT’s Class I inception date is January 1, 2017. Private real estate reflects the net total return as of March 31, 2025, which is the latest data available.
During the period from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2025, BREIT Class I’s annualized total net return of 9.4% was 2.7x the NFI-ODCE annualized total net return of 3.5% and ~65% higher than the MSCI US REIT Index annualized total return of 5.7%.
S&P 500 reflects total return. Corporate bonds reflect the total return of the ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index. BREIT does not trade on a national securities exchange, and therefore, is generally illiquid. The volatility and risk profile of the indices presented are likely to be materially different from that of BREIT including that BREIT's fees and expenses may be higher and BREIT shares are significantly less liquid than publicly traded companies. See “Important Disclosure Information–Index Definitions.”3
Cash flow growth refers to same property net operating income (“NOI”) growth. Reflects BREIT’s year-over-year preliminary estimated same property NOI growth for the year to date period ended March 31, 2025 (based on the midpoint of the preliminary estimated range of same property NOI). See “Important Disclosure Information–Preliminary Estimated Same Property NOI Growth.”4
Morningstar Direct, NCREIF, as of December 31, 2024. BREIT does not trade on a national securities exchange, and therefore, is generally illiquid. The volatility and risk profile of the indices presented are likely to be materially different from that of BREIT including that BREIT’s fees and expenses may be higher and BREIT shares are significantly less liquid than publicly traded companies. There can be no assurance that any Blackstone fund or investment will be able to implement its investment strategy, achieve its objectives or avoid substantial losses. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Reflects annual gross total returns and represents the 8 calendar-year periods since 1980 when the S&P 500 generated a negative return. Private real estate reflects the NFI-ODCE index, which reflects total returns of various private real estate funds and should not be considered reflective of the performance of BREIT. Indices are meant to illustrate general market performance. Since 1980 the S&P 500 has returned, on average, +13% returns while private real estate returned, on average, +8% returns. Comparisons shown are for informational purposes only, do not represent specific investments and are not a portfolio allocation recommendation. Over the last 20 years, (2005-2024), the S&P 500 and NFI-ODCE index have had a 0.0 correlation. 2 of the 8 years occurred after BREIT’s inception, 2018 and 2022. In 2018, the S&P 500 generated a -4.4% return and private real estate generated a 8.3% return. In 2022, the S&P 500 generated a -18.1% return and private real estate generated a 7.5% return. BREIT Class I returned 8.3% in 2018 and 8.4% in 2022. Please see www.breit.com/performance for information on BREIT returns. See “Important Disclosure Information–Index Definitions” and “–Trends.”5
Reflects the current month’s Class I distribution annualized and divided by the prior month’s net asset value, which is inclusive of all fees and expenses. Annualized distribution rate for the other share classes: Class D: 4.7%, Class S: 3.9% and Class T: 4.0%. Distributions are not guaranteed and may be funded from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, borrowings, the sale of our assets, repayments of our real estate debt investments, ROC or offering proceeds, and advances or the deferral of fees and expenses. We have no limits on the amounts we may fund from such sources. Our inception to date cash flows from operating activities, along with net gains from investment realizations, have funded 100% of our distributions through December 31, 2024. See ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities -Distributions"" on BREIT's Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. A portion of REIT ordinary income distributions may be tax deferred given the ability to characterize ordinary income as ROC. ROC distributions reduce the stockholder’s tax basis in the year the distribution is received, and generally defer taxes on that portion until the stockholder’s stock is sold via redemption. Upon redemption, the investor may be subject to higher capital gains taxes as a result of a lower cost basis due to the ROC distributions. Certain non-cash deductions, such as depreciation and amortization, lower the taxable income for REIT distributions. BREIT’s ROC in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 was 66%, 97%, 90%, 100%, 92%, 94%, 85% and 96%, respectively. See “Important Disclosure Information” including “Tax Information.”6
7.5% tax-equivalent distribution rate assumes that the investment in BREIT shares is not sold or redeemed and reflects the pre-tax distribution rate an investor would need to receive from a theoretical investment to match the 4.8% after-tax distribution rate earned by a BREIT Class I stockholder based on BREIT’s 2024 ROC of 96%, if the distributions from the theoretical investment (i) were classified as ordinary income subject to tax at the top marginal tax rate of 37%, (ii) did not benefit from the 20% tax rate deduction and (iii) were not classified as ROC. The ordinary income tax rate could change in the future. Tax-equivalent distribution rate for the other share classes are as follows: Class D: 7.3%; Class S: 6.2%; and Class T: 6.3%. The tax-equivalent distribution rate would be reduced by 1.4%, 1.4%, 1.2% and 1.2% for Class I, D, S and T shares, respectively, taking into account deferred capital gains tax that would be payable upon redemption. This assumes a one-year holding period and includes the impact of deferred capital gains tax incurred in connection with a redemption of BREIT shares. Upon redemption, an investor is assumed to be subject to tax on all prior ROC
distributions at the current maximum capital gains rate of 20%. The capital gains rate could change in the future. At this time, the 20% rate deduction to individual tax rates on the ordinary income portion of distributions is set to expire on December 31, 2025. See “Important Disclosure Information–Tax Information” for more information.

There is no assurance that any Blackstone fund or strategy will effectively hedge inflation. Inflation hedge refers to growth in real estate net operating income (“NOI”) generally outpacing inflation. NOI reflects Green Street Advisors data, as of December 31, 2024. 2024 NOI growth represents year-end estimate as of February 5, 2025. U.S. CPI reflects Bureau of Labor Statistics data, as of December 31, 2024. NOI growth represents the average NOI growth by year across the equal-weighted average of the asset-weighted average of the multifamily, industrial, mall, office and shopping center sectors. Multifamily refers to apartments; shopping center refers to strip retail. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services. NOI may not be correlated to or continue to keep pace with inflation. See “Important Disclosure Information–Trends.”17“Property Sector” weighting is measured as the asset value of real estate investments for each sector category divided by the asset value of all of BREIT’s real estate investments, excluding the value of any third-party interests in such real estate investments. Rental housing includes the following subsectors: multifamily (21%, including senior housing, which accounts for <1%), student housing (9%), single family rental housing (9%, including manufactured housing, which accounts for 1%) and affordable housing (8%). Please see the prospectus for more information on BREIT’s investments.“Region Concentration” represents regions as defined by the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (“NCREIF”) and the weighting is measured as the asset value of real estate properties for each regional category divided by the asset value of all of BREIT’s real estate properties, excluding the value of any third-party interests in such real estate properties. “Sunbelt” reflects the South and West regions of the U.S. as defined by NCREIF. “Non-U.S.” reflects investments in Europe and Canada.

Index Definitions
An investment in BREIT is not a direct investment in real estate, and has material differences from a direct investment in real estate, including those related to fees and expenses, liquidity and tax treatment. BREIT’s share price is subject to less volatility because its per share NAV is based on the value of real estate assets it owns and is not subject to market pricing forces as are the prices of the asset classes represented by the indices presented. Although BREIT’s share price is subject to less volatility, BREIT shares are significantly less liquid than these asset classes, and are not immune to fluctuations. Private real estate is not traded on an exchange and will have less liquidity and price transparency. The value of private real estate may fluctuate and may be worth less than was initially paid for it.
The volatility and risk profile of the indices presented is likely to be materially different from that of BREIT including those related to fees and expenses, liquidity, safety, and tax features. In addition, the indices employ different investment guidelines and criteria than BREIT; as a result, the holdings in BREIT may differ significantly from the holdings of the securities that comprise the indices. The indices are not subject to fees or expenses, are meant to illustrate general market performance and it may not be possible to invest in the indices. The performance of the indices has not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark to compare to BREIT’s performance, but rather is disclosed to allow for comparison of BREIT’s performance to that of well-known and widely recognized indices. A summary of the investment guidelines for the indices presented is available upon request. In the case of equity indices, performance of the indices reflects the reinvestment of dividends.
BREIT does not trade on a national securities exchange, and therefore, is generally illiquid. Your ability to redeem shares in BREIT through BREIT’s share repurchase plan may be limited, and fees associated with the sale of these products can be higher than other asset classes. In some cases, periodic distributions may be subsidized by borrowed funds and include a return of investor principal. This is in contrast to the distributions investors receive from large corporate stocks that trade on national exchanges, which are typically derived solely from earnings. Investors typically seek income from distributions over a period of years. Upon liquidation, ROC may be more or less than the original investment depending on the value of assets.
An investment in BREIT (i) differs from the Green Street Commercial Property Price Index in that such index represents various private real estate values with differing sector concentrations (ii) differs from high yield bonds and the ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index in that private real estate investments are not fixed-rate debt instruments and such bonds represent debt issued by corporations across a variety of issuers with varying pricing, terms and conditions, (iii) differs from the MSCI U.S. REIT Index in that BREIT is not a publicly traded U.S. Equity REIT, (iv) differs from the NFI-ODCE in that such index represents various private real estate funds with differing terms and strategies, and (v) differs from equities and the S&P 500 Index in that private real estate investments are not large or mid cap stocks and are not publicly traded.
The Green Street Commercial Property Price Index (“CPPI”) is a value-weighted time series of unleveraged U.S. commercial property values with an inception date of December 31, 1997. CPPI is shown to illustrate general market trends for informational purposes only, does not represent any specific investment and does not reflect how BREIT has performed or will perform in the future. The index captures the prices at which commercial real estate transactions are currently being negotiated and contracted, measuring price changes across select property types covered by Green Street Advisors. All Property Sector weights: retail (20%), apartments (15%), health care (15%), industrial (12.5%), office (12.5%), lodging (7.5%), data center (5%), net lease (5%), self-storage (5%), and manufactured home park (2.5%). Apartments refers to multifamily, lodging refers to hospitality.
The ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index is a capitalization-weighted index that measures the performance of USD-denominated, below investment grade rated, fixed rate corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. An investment in high-yield corporate bonds is generally considered to be a less risky investment than private real estate.
The MSCI U.S. REIT Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is comprised of equity REITs. The index is based on the MSCI USA Investable Market Index (IMI), its parent index, which captures large, mid and small cap securities. It represents about 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. The index is calculated with dividends reinvested on a daily basis.
The NFI-ODCE is a capitalization-weighted, gross of fees, time-weighted return index with an inception date of December 31, 1977. Published reports also contain equal-weighted and net of fees information. Open-end funds are generally defined as infinite-life vehicles consisting of multiple investors who have the ability to enter or exit the fund on a periodic basis, subject to contribution and/or redemption requests, thereby providing a degree of potential investment liquidity. The term diversified core equity typically reflects lower risk investment strategies utilizing low leverage and is generally represented by equity ownership positions in stable U.S. operating properties diversified across regions and property types. While funds used in the NFI-ODCE have characteristics that differ from BREIT (including differing management fees and leverage), BREIT’s management feels that the NFI-ODCE is an appropriate and accepted index for the purpose of evaluating the total returns of direct real estate funds. Comparisons shown are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent specific investments. Investors cannot invest in this index. BREIT has the ability to utilize higher leverage than is allowed for the funds in the NFI-ODCE, which could increase BREIT’s volatility relative to the index. Additionally, an investment in BREIT is subject to certain fees that are not contemplated in the NFI-ODCE.
The S&P 500 Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that includes 500 stocks representing all major industries. Returns are denominated in U.S. dollars. The S&P 500 Index is a proxy of the performance of the broad U.S. economy through changes in aggregate market value. The S&P 500 Index is a widely used barometer of U.S. stock market performance. The key risk of the S&P 500 Index is the volatility that comes with exposure to the stock market.
